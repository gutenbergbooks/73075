<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br>

The Night Before</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was the eve of Little Clumpton <i>versus</i>
Hickory. To those who are unfamiliar with
these haunts of ancient peace this may seem a
chronicle of the infinitely little. The Utopians,
however, dwelling there remote, were quite aware
that Waterloo, nay, even the Battle of Omdurman,
was a picnic in comparison with Little Clumpton
<i>versus</i> Hickory. Therefore let the nations heed.</p>

<p>Half our team were sitting in my billiard-room
discussing the prospects of the morrow. Opinion
really was unanimous for once: Little Clumpton
<i>must</i> not lose.</p>

<p>“Lose!” said the Optimist grandly, “is it
England, or is it Hickory?”</p>

<p>“Only Hickory,” said the Pessimist, “and the
Trenthams.”</p>

<p>“It can be W. G. and Jackson, if they like to
bring ’em,” said the Optimist; “and then they’ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
finish sick. They’ll simply flop before Charlie’s
ribsters, and Billy’s slows.”</p>

<p>“H’m!” said the Pessimist.</p>

<p>“Think so?” said the Worry.</p>

<p>“Certain,” said the Optimist. “Before now
we’ve had ’em out for fifty.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the Pessimist, “and before now
we’ve had ’em out for three hundred and fifty.”</p>

<p>“But,” said the Humourist, “I hadn’t developed
my head-ball then.”</p>

<p>The Humourist would find it as difficult to exist
without his “head-ball,” as Attewell without his
gentle maiden.</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose it all depends upon the
weather,” said the Worry, with his usual inconsequence.
“How’s the glass?”</p>

<p>“Quite well, thank you,” said the Humourist,
brandishing a huge whisky and Apollinaris.</p>

<p>“Going down,” said the Treasurer, with great
gloominess. The Treasurer had been elected to his
dignity because it was feared that he was Scotch
on his mother’s side.</p>

<p>Here the Captain came into the conversation.
He took his corn-cob slowly from his mouth,
pressed the tobacco down with that air of simple
majesty that is the hall-mark of the great, and
then began to smoke again in a very solemn
manner. This, for the Captain, was a speech.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
And as it is only the fool who can speak without
giving himself away, this was as it should be.
His words were fit though few. Hence the tradition,
that though he didn’t say much his ideas
were very beautiful. The Secretary regularly
sat in a listening attitude behind his chair, so
that if by any chance the great man did commit
an utterance, he could jot it down upon his cuff.
And it was an open secret that every time the
Secretary changed his shirt he entered the Captain’s
requests for a milk and soda or a pipe-light
in the archives of the Club.</p>

<p>The Captain was the gentlest of men. There
was a suavity in his coffee-coloured face and his
pale blue eye that grew positively weird in one
who was good for another fifty every time he had
the screen moved. Though he had developed a
peculiar habit of playing for the Gentlemen at
Lord’s, he had a charity that covered a multitude
of umpires, and when l.b.w. did not attempt to
demonstrate to the pavilion by the laws of Sir Isaac
Newton that the ball had not pitched straight by
the vulgarest fraction of an inch. His mien had
the wholly classic calm of those who have their
biographies in Wisden. His language in its robustest
passages was as fragile as Mrs. Meynell’s
prose. If a small boy danced behind the bowler’s
arm, it was claimed for the Captain that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
actually employed “please” and “thank you.”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
Even in the throes of a run out his talk retained
its purity to a remarkable degree. His strongest
expletive was a pained expression. His beverage
seldom rose beyond a milk and soda. Life with
him was a very chaste affair.</p>

<p>The Secretary was of another kidney. He
always got up a bit before the lark, since his
rule of life was to get a start of the rest of
nature. He was eminently fitted for great place.
Had he been other than Secretary to the Little
Clumpton Cricket Club he must have been Secretary
for Foreign Affairs, and dictated carefully
chosen insults to the French and other dwellers
in outer darkness. Nevertheless, he was all things
to all men. He could be as persuasive as tobacco,
he could unloose the wrath of Jove. If you came
to him at the eleventh hour and said: “Beastly
sorry, Lawson, but can’t possibly play to-morrow,”
you could rely on his well of English being defiled.
On the other hand, if he came to you and said:
“I say, old man, Jordan’s lost his jolly aunt;
Boulter’s split his blighted thumb, and I really
can’t take no, you know, shall want your batting
awful bad, you know,” his accent was a song. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
was the only man who could subdue the best
bowler when the slips weren’t snapping ’em. He
was the only man who dared address the Captain
on the field. He had the courage to explain to
the fair sex, “what those strange things in white
coats with mufflers round their waists are standing
there for?” He could suggest to the intelligent
foreigner that <i>the criquette</i> is a sport, not a religious
exercise; and he was such a fine tactician that
he always fielded point. Merryweather, known
familiarly as “Jessop,” because of his audacity,
was the one person who ventured to tell the
Secretary that he couldn’t play to-morrow, “as
I’m going golfing.” And even he, lion-hearted
as he was, presently gave up that pastime for less
violent amusements. “Billiards gone to grass,”
the Secretary considered an insufficient phrase,
but the Secretary’s views on golf are not going
to be printed.</p>

<p>Lawson’s was not the highest form of cricket.
His bowling was a jest; his batting was a comic
interlude. Yet his Captain was wont to say,
“Give me Lawson at a pinch, and I’ll give
you Grace and Ranjitsinhji.” For his force of
character was such that when the bowling was
used up he would go on with lobs and take a
wicket; when a rot set in, before going in to
stop it, he would tell them to send him a cup of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
tea at five; whilst he was such a master in the
art of playing for a draw that light-minded persons
called him “Notts.” True, his style was not
the style of Gunn and Shrewsbury, nor were his
methods conspicuously pretty, but none the less
he was the source of several letters to the M.C.C.
As an instance of his powers, last year but one,
against I. Zingari, he stayed two hours for seven,
brought down the rain and saved the match.
There was not a breath of vanity about him, and
in appearance he looked quite a simple ordinary
soul. But if it was an absolute necessity that
Little Clumpton should win the toss, the Captain
generally sent Lawson out to spin; and if the
other side, in the innocence of their hearts, thought
they knew a trick that Little Clumpton didn’t, the
Secretary usually held it right to encourage them
in that opinion.</p>

<p>Now though there was not a man present who
would have admitted for a moment that he had
the faintest fear of Hickory, there was no overriding
the hard fact that the Captain had twice
withdrawn his pipe from his mouth in the space
of twenty minutes. The Secretary had noted this
grim portent as he noted everything, and sat
tugging his moustache with one hand, whilst with
the other he worked out the Theory of the Toss
(invented by himself) to five places of decimals.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
Indeed, such an air of gloom presently settled on
us all that the Pessimist declared that we had
got already a bad attack of the Trenthams. Perhaps
we had. Never previously had we faced
more than two members of this redoubtable family
at a time, but report said that to-morrow we must
suffer the full brotherhood of four. Their deeds
that season had been more terrible than ever.
A. H., of Middlesex, had helped himself to 146
against Surrey at the Oval the previous week,
and was going out with Stoddart in the autumn.
H. C. was reputed to be the best bowler either
’Varsity had seen since Sammy Woods, an opinion
poor Oxford had subscribed to in July at Lord’s;
Captain George, although he liked to call himself
a veteran, had an average of 72·3 for the Royal
Artillery; whilst T. S. M., the Harrow Captain,
had enjoyed the Eton match very much indeed,
and rather thought he should enjoy the match with
Little Clumpton too. As if this was not enough, the
General Nuisance presently sauntered in, exactly
an hour behind his time as usual. And to the
consternation of us all the General Nuisance wore
his most expansive simper.</p>

<p>“He’s only heard that the Trenthams are coming,”
said the Worry. By trying to reassure us
he sought to reassure himself.</p>

<p>“Confound you! are you going to dislocate your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
face?” said the Secretary, aiming a cushion and
a string of unprintable expressions at the General
Nuisance. “What’s up now? Is Charlie crocked?
Is Billy drinking? Good Lord! I hope there’s
nothing gone wrong with the bowling!”</p>

<p>“Not yet,” said the General Nuisance sweetly;
“but there will be, I’ll give you <i>my</i> word.”</p>

<p>“We shall have to try that muck o’ yours then,”
said the Pessimist.</p>

<p>“Unfortunately I’m not playing to-morrow;
I’m going fishing,” said the General Nuisance
affably.</p>

<p>“Eh? What?”</p>

<p>It was the voice of the Secretary from behind the
Captain’s chair. It was a psychological moment.
Each man present had that nightmare of a feeling
that afflicts you in the long-field when A. H.
Trentham lifts one to you steeples high, curling
some fifteen ways at once, which all the time you
are hopelessly misjudging and that you know you
are bound to drop. However, I had the presence
of mind to distract the General Nuisance with a
drink, while the Captain laid a soothing hand on
the Secretary’s knee, and appealed to his moral
nature. Brandy and soda, one grieves to say,
inflamed rather than appeased the personal appearance
of the General Nuisance. His simper
became a grin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>“Pipe up,” said that heroical man, the Treasurer,
preparing for the worst; “out with it.”</p>

<p>“You will be very brave?” said the General
Nuisance.</p>

<p>“Comfort, you blackguard,” said the Secretary,
“Why do you grin? Speak or die!”</p>

<p>When the General Nuisance grinned, homicidal
tendencies soiled minds of the most virgin whiteness.</p>

<p>The Captain took his pipe out and tapped it on
his boot. It was a command that even the revolutionary
spirit of the General Nuisance dared not
disregard. It had the authority of an Act of
Parliament.</p>

<p>“Well, brethren,” said the General Nuisance,
“they are bringing Carteret and Elphinstone,
that’s all.”</p>

<p>“And the Trenthams, too?” said I.</p>

<p>“And the Trenthams, too,” said he.</p>

<p>“It’s a good job we’re a good team,” said the
Humourist.</p>

<p>It is true that the Secretary sat behind the
Captain’s chair, but in the course of three minutes
he contrived to emit such a quantity of language
of a free and painful character, that to relieve
the tension the Humourist kindly propounded this
conundrum. Why is Bobby Abel batting like
Lawson’s small talk? Because to look at ’em<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
you’d wonder how they could. This, I regret to
say, is quite in the Humourist’s early manner, ere
art had chastened nature. It lacks the polished
pathos of those slow-drawn agonies at which the
world grew pale. But as the Humourist strutted in
his title because he took himself quite seriously,
do not let us forget that this offspring of his wit
was born in an hour of mental stress.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br>

Coming Events</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AT six next morning my man found me in
pyjamas, flourishing a bat up and down a
chalk line on the bedroom carpet.</p>

<p>“Are you quite sure it’s perfectly straight,
William?”</p>

<p>“Quite straight, sir; but mind the wardrobe
door, sir!”</p>

<p>“I think I’ll try that blind hit of Gunn’s between
point and cover.”</p>

<p>“All right, sir; if you’ll just wait while I move
the water-jug. Your left leg a little more across—just
a little; and how’s the late cut this morning,
sir?”</p>

<p>“Never healthier in its life. Here you are.
Look out!”</p>

<p>Crash! Plop! The glass in the wardrobe door
had met the fate of its predecessors. The aggravating
thing about the wardrobe door is that if
you have it of glass you must inevitably break it;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
yet should you have a plain panel you can’t see
what angle your bat’s at and where your feet are.</p>

<p>“I was hoping all the time that you’d smash
it, sir,” said William in a confidential tone. “It’s
a strange thing, sir, but every time you smash the
wardrobe door you never get less than 50. If
you remember, when you got that 82 last year
against the Free Foresters you smashed it the
morning of the match. Then that 61 against
M.C.C. (O’Halloran and Roche an’ all), same thing
occurred, if you recollect. And it’s my belief
that you’ve smashed it worse this morning, sir,
than you’ve ever done before. It <i>might</i> be the
century to-day, sir.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if the water-jug or washhand-stand
would help it,” said I reflectively; “because,
William, if you really think they would——”</p>

<p>“Somehow,” said William hastily, “I haven’t
quite the same faith in that there water-jug. I
remember once you cracked it right across the spout
and got ‘run out 3’ on that particular mornin’.
Captain Cooper called you, and then sent you
back, if you remember, sir, when you was halfway
down the pitch.”</p>

<p>“I remember,” I groaned. “Those are the
tragedies of which our little life is made!”</p>

<p>“And the washhand-stand ain’t no good at all,
sir. Why, when you knocked the leg off it in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
giving Mold the wood, you bagged a brace at
Pigeon Hill that day on what they called a wicket,
but what was really a hornamental lake.”</p>

<p>“Spare me the horrible details, William,” I said.
A cold sensation was creeping down my spine.</p>

<p>Having tubbed and shaved I felt so fit as I
walked down to have a look at the ground before
breakfast that I had to restrain myself from jumping
five-barred gates. It was a perfect morning,
flushed with summer. The birds on the
boughs were welcoming the young sun; the
mists were running before him; the dew on the
trees was dancing to him; whilst the drenched
meadows and the cool haze receding to the hills
promised ninety in the shade to follow. Evidently
Nature, like a downright good sportsman, was
going to let us have a real cricketers’ day for a
true cricketing occasion. Such fragrance made
the blood leap. Every muscle seemed electric.
To snuff the chill airs was to feel as fit and
full of devil as a racehorse. By Jove, I felt like
getting ’em! There were clean off-drives in the
eager brooks, clipping cuts for four in the sparkling
grass, sweet leg glances in the singing hedgerows,
inimitable hooks and behind-the-wicket strokes
in the cheerful field noises and the bird-thrilled
branches; and when the sun burst out more fully
in premonition of what was to be his magnificent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
display at Little Clumpton <i>versus</i> Hickory later in
the day, I said to an unresponsive cow, “How do
you like that, H. C.?” for I had just lifted the best
bowler at either ’Varsity since Sammy Woods,
clean out of the ground for six. And having
begun to this tune, of course I went on getting ’em.
I continued cutting, driving, and leg hitting at such
a pace, that by the time I had made the half-mile
to the ground that morning, a mere five minutes’
walk, I was rapidly approaching my century.
They may talk of Jessop, but I think this gives
a long start to any performances of his, although
it is possible that he may have had to meet
bowling rather more “upon the spot.” I was in
great form though.</p>

<p>I found the ground-man standing beside the
wicket, looking at it lovingly. He had his head
on one side, as he gazed with an air as of Michael
Angelo surveying his masterpiece.</p>

<p>“Mornin’ to you, sir!”</p>

<p>“Mornin’ Wiggles. How’s the wicket?”</p>

<p>“This ain’t no wicket, sir. It’s a bloomin’
billiard-table wot Dawson’s a’ inviting of Roberts
to come and play on. And Lord, sir, have you seed
the side that Hickory’s a-bringing—a bloomin’
county team. There’s them there Trenthams, all
the boiling of ’em, and Carteret and Elphinstone
of Kent. They do say as how Francis Ford and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
Fry’s a-coming, too, as Hickory’s a bit weak in
batting like, seeing as how Billy Thumbs the
cobbler’s short o’ practice. Well, sir, I on’y hopes
they comes, and Ranjy with ’em, because, if you
come to think on it, Hickory ain’t got no side at
all. And such a piece of concrete wot’s awaiting
’em! ’Tween you and me, sir, I think if I was a
bowler I should take to batting for to-day.”</p>

<p>“We had better win the toss then,” I said
gloomily.</p>

<p>“That’s a very good idea, sir, for I’m thinking
whoever gets in on this, somebody’ll be so tired
afore six-thirty.”</p>

<p>Looking at that wicket and brooding on the
awful array of batsmen Hickory was bringing, and
what the result must be if they only got in first, I
was tempted of the devil. The turf was soft with
dew. I had merely to press my heel once into
that billiard-table to nip some of their prospective
centuries in the bud. And who shall say whether
human frailty had prevailed against the wiles of
evil had it not remembered that Hickory were not
<i>obliged</i> to go in first.</p>

<p>I went home to breakfast trying to restrain my
excess of “fitness.” For cricket is cussedness incarnate.
You rise in the morning like a giant
refreshed: your blood is jumping, the ball looks as
big as a balloon, and you have a go at one you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
ought to let alone, and spoon it up to cover.
Excess of “fitness” gets more wickets than
Lohmann ever took.</p>

<p>I was in the middle of the <i>Sportsman</i> and my
fourth egg when William appeared with a countenance
of tragedy.</p>

<p>“I can’t find it, sir; it’s clean gone!” he
said.</p>

<p>“Not the bat with the wrapping at the bottom?”
I gasped, turning pale.</p>

<p>“No, sir; worse than that,” he said.</p>

<p>“Speak!” I cried; “what is it?”</p>

<p>“Your cap,” he said. “The one you made the
82, the 61, and 67 not out in.”</p>

<p>“What, the Authentics! It must be found, or
I don’t go in to-day. Couldn’t get a run without
that cap.”</p>

<p>The sweat stood on my brow.</p>

<p>“It’s my belief, sir,” said William darkly, “that
this here’s a bit O’ Hickory. They knows how, like
W. G., its always one particular cap you gets your
runs in, and they’ve had it took according.”</p>

<p>This was very nice of William. His tact was
charming. But the idea of my facing Hickory
without my lucky cap was as monstrous as the
captain going out to toss without his George
II. shilling.</p>

<p>“William,” I said, “if you have to take the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
carpets up and have the chimneys swept, that cap
must be found.”</p>

<p>William returned disconsolately to his search,
whilst I fell into a train of dismal speculation.
Falling to the <i>Sportsman</i> in despair my eye fell
on a few items of a cheerful and peculiar
interest:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Kent</span> <i>v.</i> <span class="smcap">Notts</span>.—Rev. E. J. H. Elphinstone, c
Jones, b Attewell, 172; J. P. Carteret, b Dixon,
103.</p>

<p>“This brilliant pair of amateurs completely
collared the Notts attack at Canterbury yesterday,
and in the course of two hours and a quarter
helped themselves to 254 for the second wicket.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Middlesex</span> <i>v.</i> <span class="smcap">Yorkshire</span>.—A. H. Trentham,
run out, 97.</p>

<p>“Yesterday, at Lord’s, that delightful batsman,
A. H. Trentham, reduced the resourceful Yorkshire
bowling to something that bore a family resemblance
to common piffle. To the great disappointment
of the enthusiastic company<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> he had the
misfortune to be beautifully thrown out by F. S.
Jackson when within three of the coveted three
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>figures. Among his strokes were seventeen
fours, including a couple of remarkable drives off
Rhodes into the pavilion seats. Had he topped the
century yesterday it would have been his fifth this
season in county cricket. As it is, he is still second
in the first-class averages; and we certainly think
that the Old Country is to be congratulated on
having A. H. Trentham to represent her in the
forthcoming test games in Australia. His absolute
confidence and his fine forcing method, it is not
premature to say, will be seen to singular advantage
on the fast and true colonial grounds.”</p>
</div>

<p>Reader (<i>loquitur</i>): “Damn his fine forcing
method! I wonder why Wiggles hadn’t the sense
to water that wicket. Anyway, I wish Jacker
had let him have his fling. They’re always worse
when they’ve been run out.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Household Brigade</span> <i>v.</i> <span class="smcap">Royal Artillery</span>.—Captain
Trentham, c Wolseley, b Kitchener, 150.</p>

<p>“Playing for C.U.L.V.C. <i>v.</i> N. F. Druce’s XI.
yesterday, H. C. Trentham, the crack Cambridge
bowler, took nine wickets for eight runs. His performance
included the ‘hat trick.’ The ball with
which he bowled Prince Ranjitsinhji knocked one
bail a distance of fifty-nine yards five and half
inches. We believe we are correct in saying that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
this is a world’s record, providing that ‘up
country in Australia,’ that home of the cricket
miracle, is unable to furnish anything to beat it.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Harrow Wanderers</span> <i>v.</i> <span class="smcap">Gentlemen of Cheshire</span>.—T.
S. M. Trentham, not out, 205.”</p>

<p>“We have it from a reliable source,” says the
<i>Athletic News</i>, “that the authorities at Old Trafford
are making strenuous efforts to induce Mr. T. S.
M. Trentham, this year’s captain at Harrow, and
the youngest member of the famous brotherhood
whose name he bears, to qualify for Lancashire.
As doubtless our readers are aware, the authorities
at Old Trafford have always been justly celebrated
for their generous appreciation and encouragement
of the cricketing talent of <i>other</i> counties, and in the
case of young Mr. Trentham there is something
peculiarly appropriate in the benevolence of their
present attitude, as it is rumoured that Mr.
Trentham once had an aunt who lived near
Bootle.”</p>
</div>

<p>I could read no more. The <i>Sportsman</i> dropped
from my unheeding hands, and I had just begun
to whistle the opening bars of the “Dead March,”
when two brown boots and the lower parts of a
pair of grey flannel trousers wriggled from the
lawn through the open window. They were surmounted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
two seconds later by a straw hat, a straw-coloured
moustache, and an aquiline nose, which I
identified as belonging to the General Nuisance.
He had an exquisitely neat brown paper parcel
under his arm, and a smile of fifty candle-power
illuminating his classic features. I was horrified
to see it.</p>

<p>“You’re early this morning,” I said resignedly.
“It wants a quarter to eight yet. Have some
breakfast?”</p>

<p>“Tha-anks,” he drawled, “but I’ve had my milk.
I’ve called round to bring you yours.”</p>

<p>As he spoke he removed the string from the parcel
in the most leisurely manner and disclosed a pile
of carefully folded newspapers with names pencilled
on the corners. Having discovered mine,
he handed it to me with that air of benevolent
condescension that head masters wear on speech
day.</p>

<p>“How nice of you!” I said. However, I’m
afraid this irony was so delicate that he didn’t
feel it.</p>

<p>“My dear fellow, not at all,” he said. “There’s
one for everybody. I’m delivering ’em to the
whole team, don’t you know.”</p>

<p>Needless to say, he had presented me with an
immaculate copy of the <i>Sportsman</i>. I picked up
my own discarded sheet from under the table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>“Awf’ly obliged, old chap, but I’ve got one,
thank you,” I said, pleasantly.</p>

<p>“That’s lucky,” said he, “you can give one
to your friends. Rather pretty reading, isn’t
it? Awf’ly decent set, Trenthams, Elphinstone,
etcetera.”</p>

<p>“Git!” I said, gazing round for a boot-jack
or a poker, or something equally likely to debase
his physical beauty.</p>

<p>“Ta-ta then, see you later!”</p>

<p>To my infinite joy he appeared to be taking
the hint. But he had only just conducted his
infernal smile to the right side of the window,
when he jerked it back again, and said:—</p>

<p>“Oh, I forgot! I say, Dimsdale, I ought to tell
you this. I rather think Billy <i>was</i> drunk last
night. His eyes are as red as a ferret’s this morning,
and his housekeeper told me in confidence
that when she got up this morning and went to
call him she found master’s umbrella in bed and
master sleeping in the umbrella-stand.”</p>

<p>“No, don’t say that,” I gasped, with a sinking
at the heart. Alas! we’d only got two bowlers,
and Billy was the one on whom we depended
most.</p>

<p>“Fact!” said the General Nuisance cheerfully;
“wouldn’t trouble you with it if I thought it wasn’t
true. Lawson drove up with the Doctor as I came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
away. I implored our gentle secretary not to
mourn, since a few Seidlitzs and a stomach-pump
can do a lot in a very little time. I don’t
know if you’ve noticed it, but it is generally
slow bowlers who resort to intemperance, because
as they’ve only got to lose their perfect
length to embitter the lives of others, their possibilities
become quite unbearable on a big occasion.
At the M.C.C. match Lawson sat beside him at
lunch both days counting his liqueurs. Poor old
Lawson! I felt it my duty to assure him just
now that it really took very little to make Billy
lose his length. I also took the liberty of reminding
him of what happened when he lost it once
before, against Emeriti,—</p>

<p class="center">
5 overs.<span class="gap">0 maidens.</span><span class="gap">51 runs.</span><span class="gap">0 wickets.</span></p>

<p>and Emeriti had got quite an ordinary side.”</p>

<p>Just as the muffineer arrived at the head of the
General Nuisance, the General Nuisance was mean
enough to duck. This act enabled the muffineer to
crash through the plate-glass window.</p>

<p>“Timed that to a ‘T,’” said he. “Can see
absolutely anything this morning. Certain to book
fifty if I once get in, which I take to be a strong
enough reason why an inscrutable Providence will
cause us to lose the toss and keep me in the field
all day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>“Hope you will be there,” said I savagely, “and
I’d like to see you taking long-field on both ends.
And I hope you’ll drop a catch in front of the
ladies’ tent. And I hope when you come racing
round the corner to make that magnificent one-hand
dive to save the four, the bally thing’ll jump
and hit you in the teeth. And if you do go in to
bat I hope you’ll be bowled neck and heels first
ball.”</p>

<p>Ignoring this peroration he again appeared to be
at the point of withdrawing his hateful presence.
But too well did I know the General Nuisance to
anticipate such a consummation. He merely seated
himself on the sill in an attitude that would enable
him to cope with sudden emergencies, and then
said:—</p>

<p>“Oh, by the way, the youngest Gunter girl; you
know, the little one with the green eyes and the
freckles—just got engaged they say.”</p>

<p>“Who to?” I said fiercely. The General Nuisance
certainly plumbed the depths of human
fiendishness, but in conversation he had a command
of topics that were irresistible.</p>

<p>“Who to?” I said.</p>

<p>“One of the Trenthams,” he smiled. “Ta-ta!
See you ten-thirty.”</p>

<p>He was gone at last, and I had barely time to
praise Heaven’s clemency that this was even so,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
when William entered with the face of an undertaker
out of work.</p>

<p>“Clean gone, sir,” he said. “Abso-blooming-lutely!
Looked high and low, and Mrs. Jennings
ain’t no notion.”</p>

<p>“Looked in the lining of the bag?”</p>

<p>“Everywhere,” said the miserable William.</p>

<p>“Well,” said I, “unless it’s found I don’t get a
run to-day.”</p>

<p>“I can tell you, sir,” said William, “that I’d
rather lose my perquisites than that this should
have ’appened at Little Clumpton <i>v.</i> Hickory. But
there’s the Winchester, and the Magdalen, and the
M.C.C. Couldn’t you get some in one of them,
sir?”</p>

<p>“Daren’t risk it,” I said, “not at Little Clumpton
<i>v.</i> Hickory. Yet, let me see, hasn’t Mr.
Thornhill one of the Authentics?”</p>

<p>“Why, Lor’ bless me, that he ’ave, sir!”</p>

<p>“Well, get your bike at once, give my compliments
and kind regards to Mr. Thornhill and tell
him I’ve lost my Authentics and will he lend me
his. Explain that it’s Little Clumpton <i>v.</i> Hickory,
and that I can only get runs in the Authentics.
It’s now eight-twenty, and it’s eighteen miles to
Mr. Thornhill’s place. Can you bring it to me by
eleven?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>“Well, sir, if I don’t, you’ll know I’ve burst a
tyre.”</p>

<p>Within five minutes William was riding to
Thornhill’s as if his life depended on it, with the
stable-boy to pace him.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br>

LITTLE CLUMPTON <i>v.</i> HICKORY</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">I &#160;CAME down to the ground at a little after ten.
The match was to begin at eleven, sharp.
The only sights of interest on my arrival were the
ground-man marking out the crease, and the Worry
at the nets in a brand-new outfit. The “pro”
and three small boys were striving to knock a
shilling off his middle.</p>

<p>“You’re touching ’em pretty this morning,
Daunton,” said I, out of pure excellence of heart.
I wished him to keep up his pecker.</p>

<p>“Think so?” he said nervously. “I’ve had
an awful bad night, and I believe there’s something
the matter with my wrist. I wish I wasn’t
playing.”</p>

<p>The Worry’s life was a burden to him on match
days. When he went in to bat he issued from the
pavilion with a wild eye and a haggard mien, and
a rooted idea that he was bound to be bowled first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
ball. This he invariably played forward to, as
the strain on his nervous system was so severe
that it was a physical impossibility for him to
wait and receive it in his crease. He counted
every run he got, and, if there was the faintest
doubt about a snick, he would say, “I hope you
noticed that I touched that, umpire.”</p>

<p>The crowd was already beginning to assemble.
Vehicles and pedestrians were flocking in from
twenty miles around. Hickory was a neighbouring
village, only seven miles distant, but the rivalry
was so keen that the local public-houses did no
trade while the great match was in progress. It
always had been so, and always would be. Even
in the early forties Little Clumpton <i>v.</i> Hickory
had become historical. Alfred Mynn and Fuller
Pilch had actually graced the annual encounter
in the Park. There was only one match a season;
two would have been more than human endurance
could have borne; and the Park, which generations
of its noble owners had been very proud to
lend for this nation-shaking function, was the only
cricket-ground in the vicinity that could hope to
accommodate the rival partisans. It might have
been that once on a time the ’Varsity match had
been played on other turf than Lord’s; but the
Park was the only spot in England that had ever
had the privilege of witnessing Little Clumpton<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
<i>v.</i> Hickory on its velvet sward. Let kings depart
and empires perish, but this always had been so
and always would be!</p>

<p>To appear at Little Clumpton <i>v.</i> Hickory was
not the lot of common men. Only the elect could
hope to do so. To take wickets or make a score
at this encounter was to become a classic in one’s
lifetime. There were hoary veterans round about,
whom the uninitiated might take to be mouldering
mediocrities, but no—“see t’ owd gaffer theer? well,
’e wor a ’56 man; and t’ littlin theer across the
rowad ’e wor ’59”—which being interpreted means
that 1856 and 1859 were the dates of their distinction.
Therefore do not let the young think,
as unhappily they do just now, that they must
write a book to become immortal. Why will not a
few thousands of these seekers after fame, these
budding novelists and early poets, take to cricket?
For is it not more honourable, and certainly more
glorious, to make a century at Little Clumpton <i>v.</i>
Hickory, and make half a shire shout your praise,
than to translate Omar Kháyyám and become a
nuisance to posterity?</p>

<p>Presently I beheld a sight that nearly brought
the tears into my eyes. The Optimist and the
Pessimist were coming arm-in-arm across the
grass. The lion lay down with the lamb at Little
Clumpton <i>v.</i> Hickory. The Secretary walked alone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
with looks and words for none. He was so positively
dangerous that the General Nuisance forbore
to ask him what bowling we had got.</p>

<p>Having changed, I was sallying forth from the
pavilion in the possession of bat and ball for the
purpose of “having a knock” when a sudden
palpitation made the crowd vibrate.</p>

<p>“’Ere’s Hickory! Good owd Hickory!”</p>

<p>A solid English-throated cheer announced that
the enemy were in sight. A thrill ran through me
as I gazed in the direction of their coming, for
certainly the appearance of such a celebrated side
was something to be seen. It was. A four-in-hand
came bumping along the stretch of uneven
meadow at a clipping pace. And to my indignant
horror and bewilderment I saw that the reins
were commanded by a person that wore nice
white cuffs and a brown holland blouse. Conceive
the cream of English cricket with their legs tucked
up on the top of that rocking, creaking, jumping,
jolting coach at the mercy of a person in a brown
holland blouse! It was a thing that required to be
very clearly seen before it could be accepted. In
agony of mind I rubbed my eyes and looked
more intently at the furiously on-coming vehicle.
Never a doubt its pace was reckless, criminally
reckless, considering the priceless freight it bore.</p>

<p>“What do you think of that?” I cried, turning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
in my distress to the man beside me. He happened
to be the Ancient, so-called, because of his thoughtful
air and his supernatural wisdom. “Just look at
the confounded thing, I’m certain that girl’ll have
it over. Gad! did you see her dodge that ditch by
about three inches? Those men must be perfect
fools! Why doesn’t that idiot beside her lend a
hand? But some of these women are steep enough
for anything. That girl ought to be talked
to.”</p>

<p>“Well, suppose you do the talking,” said the
Ancient, with his most reflective air. Then, as the
drag lurched into our midst, wheels and harness
grunting, the glossy animals in a lather; and they
were drawn up with a sure hand in front of the
pavilion while a cheering and gaping throng pressed
about the wheels to impede the great men in their
descent, the Ancient pensively continued, “Tell
you what, my boy, I should rather like the chance
of talking to that young person.”</p>

<p>To do her justice, she was certainly a source of
comfort to the eye. When she yielded the reins
and stood up on the footboard she had that air of
simple resolution that is the source of England’s
pride.</p>

<p>She was so tall and trim and strong, there was
such a decision in her curves that her brown holland
with white cuffs and collar, her Zingari tie,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
and hat-band of the same red and yellow brilliance
round a straw, with heavy coils of hair of a proper
country fawn-colour beneath, lent her that look
of candid capability that nature generally reserves
for cricketers of the highest order. I never gave
the cracks from Hickory a second thought. Everything
about her was so clean, so cool, so absolute,
that before she had left the box I had quite convinced
myself that whoever she might be she
was a young person whose habit was to do
things.</p>

<p>“Catch!” she cried, and threw down the Hickory
score-book.</p>

<p>She then superintended the unlading of the
coach roof of its pile of brown and battered cricket
bags, whilst the crowd pressed nearer to the wheels
and evinced the liveliest concern as to “which is
A. H.? And who’s the tall chap? And who’s the
Parson? And don’t he look a funny little cuss?
And who’s the very tall chap? ’Im wi’ the big
’ead? H. C. o’ course. And who’s the lamp-post?
And that theer fleshy bloke who’d got three boys to
carry his bag, a fourth to carry his hat, and a fifth
his newspaper, must be Carteret, because it said in
the <i>Daily Chronicle</i> that he was the fattest short-slip
in England and took life easily.” Of such are
fame’s penalties!</p>

<p>The young person in brown holland having made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
it her business to see that the bags were bundled
down with the necessary degree of violence, said:
“I think you men had better go and change
<i>immediately</i>. I’ll have a look at the wicket.”</p>

<p>She swung down from the step before any of the
men below could lend a hand, and, while the
whole eleven moved towards the pavilion with
their luggage, the young person in brown holland
made her way through the throng with the confidence
of a duchess at a charity bazaar, and strode
across the grass without the least suspicion of the
Meredithian “swim.” And it was quite a coincidence
that the Ancient and myself should choose
a spot as near the wicket as the unwritten laws
allowed, for the purpose of having a little practice.</p>

<p>The ground-man was lingering over the last
touches to his masterpiece when the young person
in brown holland actually set foot on the sacred
earth that the general public is not even permitted
to approach. The face of the ground-man was well
worth looking at. When the feelings of a great
artist are outraged it is a very painful sight. Alas,
poor Wiggles! the agony of his countenance no
pen could depict. He lifted up his head and emitted
a slow-drawn growl. This had no effect whatever.
Indeed, an instant later, this most audacious individual
had the incredible effrontery to bring down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
a pretty solid brown boot, by no means of the
“little mice” type either, twice upon the pitch
itself. It was more than a merely human ground-man
could endure.</p>

<p>“Begging pardon, miss,” said he, “but are you
aware, miss, that this here is a—a <i>wicket</i>?”</p>

<p>“Well, my dear man,” said the person thus addressed,
“do you suppose I thought it was a
bunker?”</p>

<p>The Ancient and I agreed that this was an
achievement. For a member of the general public
to retort effectually on a real live ground-man was
as great a feat as to look at the Chinese Emperor.
The face of Wiggles was a study. Meanwhile,
the lady having sufficiently tried the
adamantine surface with her boot, bent down and
pressed on it with her thumb. A feather would
have slain the miserable Wiggles at that moment.
Was it possible that any human creature, let alone
the sex, could presume to test, and criticise, and
doubt his masterpiece in this way! But worse
was coming. Apparently the young person in
brown holland was determined to satisfy herself
in regard to every detail.</p>

<p>“Ground-man,” she said, “has this turf any
tendency to crumble?”</p>

<p>“No, it ain’t,” said the ground-man savagely.</p>

<p>Having laid her doubts in this direction, she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
proceeded to view the wicket lengthwise. Setting
her alert tanned face in a precise line with the
stumps, she said:—</p>

<p>“Ground-man, are you sure that these sticks are
<i>quite</i> plumb!”</p>

<p>“If they ain’t it’s the fust time i’ thirty yeer.”</p>

<p>“But surely the leg peg your end wants pulling
out a bit. That’ll do. It’s all right now.”</p>

<p>When the utterly demoralised Wiggles discovered
that he had unconsciously obeyed the behests of
the young person in brown holland, I never saw
a man who more regretted his own inability to
kick himself.</p>

<p>“Well, ground-man,” she said slowly and reflectively,
“I think this wicket is good enough for
a Test Match. Here’s a shilling for you.”</p>

<p>The hesitation of Wiggles was really painful.
A shilling is a shilling always, but how could a
self-respecting ground-man accept one in these
humiliating circumstances? His views on political
economy, however, reconciled his outraged feelings
to this added insult. He took the shilling with a
defiant air.</p>

<p>“And, ground-man,” she said, “mind that I tip
you for every individual century that is got for
Hickory to-day.”</p>

<p>“Thank you kindly, miss,” said Wiggles, with
a groan. He was Little Clumpton to the marrow.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
The poor wretch cast a despairing glance at the
Ancient and myself, while we practised in the most
assiduous manner.</p>

<p>Suddenly a peal of laughter came from the young
person in brown holland. It seemed that the sight-board
in front of a dark fringe of trees behind
the bowler’s arm had attracted her polite attention.</p>

<p>“Charlie’s arm’ll be over that,” she cried delightedly.
“We’ll put him on that end.”</p>

<p>“Ancient,” said I, “do you hear what that—that
girl’s saying? Why doesn’t that idiot Wiggles
order her off the field? If she stops there much
longer we’re a beaten team.”</p>

<p>Just then she turned her attention to us engaged
in practice. Now the sight of this—this person
who was so busily occupied in laying traps and pitfalls
for Little Clumpton’s overthrow enraged me
to that degree that I determined to get rid of her
by uncompromising methods. She stood in the
exact line of my crack to cover.</p>

<p>“Ancient,” I said, “just chuck up a nice half-volley
on the off, and I’ll make this place a bit
too hot for that young person in brown holland.”</p>

<p>The Ancient lost no time in becoming accessory
before the fact, and, throwing my leg across, I
put in every ounce I’d got.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>“Oh, goo—od stroke! goo—od stroke!” cried
our intended victim in a very joyful voice. And
we had the privilege of witnessing the young
person we were conspiring to remove calmly place
her feet and hands together, as per Steel and
Lyttelton, and field and return that red-hot drive
in the neatest, cleanest, county style.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be damned,” said I.</p>

<p>“If she’s fielding cover for them,” said the
Ancient grimly, “somebody’ll be run out. We’d
better advise Lennox and Jack Comfort not to
try to steal ’em. I shan’t go for short ’uns, I
can tell you.”</p>

<p>The Ancient owed his eminence to the fact that
no detail was too mean for his capacious mind.
Besides, he was as strenuous, serious, and self-centred
as a novelist with a circulation of a
hundred thousand copies.</p>

<p>Much to the relief of Wiggles and ourselves, the
sight of a perfect broad-shouldered giant of a
fellow issuing from the pavilion at this moment,
clad in flannels, bat in hand, lured the young
person in brown holland from her very inconvenient
and highly dangerous station at the wicket.</p>

<p>“Hi, Archie, got a ball?” she cried at the pitch
of a splendid pair of lungs.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Grace!” replied the giant in a voice by
no means the inferior of her own. “You’re just the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
very chap. I want half a dozen down. Let’s
cut across there to the nets. Here you are. Look
out!”</p>

<p>Thereon the giant hurled a ball a terrific height
into the eye of the sun. It seemed so perilously
like descending on our heads that poor Wiggles
put up his hands and began to run for his life.
Not so the young person in brown holland. She
stepped two or three yards backward, moved a
little to one side, shaded her eyes a moment from
the glare to sight the catch, and next instant had
the leather tucked beautifully under her chin in
a manner worthy of a G. J. Mordaunt.</p>

<p>“Wiggles,” said I, “do you happen to know who
that lady is?”</p>

<p>“Wish I did, sir,” said Wiggles feebly. “She’s
a terror, ain’t she? But I hope she don’t come
here too often. I reckon she’s a Trentham, she is.
That wor A. H. what just come out. Lord, and
just look at that theer gal a bowlin’ at ’un. She
sets ’un back on his sticks an’ all.”</p>

<p>We turned our attention to the nets, and beheld
her bowling slow hanging length balls to A. H.
Trentham, almost a facsimile of Alfred Shaw.</p>

<p>“I tell you, Dimsdale,” said the Ancient, “if
this is what lovely woman’s coming to, it’s
high time some of us crocks took to golf. I wonder
if Miss Grace plays for M.C.C. I notice she’s got<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
their colours on. I’ve always contended that they
never look so well as when worn by W. G., but
I’m hanged if this new Grace don’t give the Old
Man points.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>

An Impossible Incident</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE great men were now coming out in twos
and threes to have a knock.</p>

<p>“Hullo!” said I, “that’s Elphinstone. Remember
him at ‘the House.’ There’s not much of
him, but what there is is all-sufficing. And just
look at those great big bounding Trenthams. Anyone
of ’em could put the little parson in his pocket.
And I say, Ancient, do you notice that the young
one, about the build of Townsend—I mean the one
clapping his hands for the ball—do you notice
that he’s an enlarged copy of the young person in
brown holland? Same hair, and eyes, and nose,
and everything; same cheerful enterprising look.
It’s a million to a hay-seed she’s a Trentham, too.”</p>

<p>But the Optimist approached, an encyclopædia
of the scientific and the useful.</p>

<p>“Brightside,” said the Ancient, “we want to
know who that girl is who’s sticking up A. H. like
Alfred Shaw.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>“Better go and ask Lawson,” said the Optimist.
“I’ve just suggested that he puts a placard up in
the refreshment tent to the effect that the singularly
interesting being in brown holland is Miss Laura
Mary Trentham, yet another member of the world-famous
cricket family of that name. Lawson’s
being simply besieged with questions.”</p>

<p>“But A. H. called her Grace just now?”</p>

<p>“Her baptismal name is Laura Mary, but they
call her Grace because she keeps five portraits
of that hero on her bedroom mantelpiece. Rumour
also says that she keeps strands of his beard
stowed away in secret drawers. This she indignantly
denies, however, as she swears that if
she’d got them she’d wear them in a brooch.”</p>

<p>“H’m! And what an extraordinary resemblance
there is between her and T. S. M.”</p>

<p>“They’re twins. She’s about an hour the older
of the two, and I believe she bullies him outrageously.
And I rather think she gives her
honourable and reverend papa, and the remainder
of the family, a pretty lively time. Why, here’s
the old gentleman himself.”</p>

<p>The Captain and the Humourist were accompanying
a fine old clergyman in an inspection of the
wicket. He was gigantically built. His perfectly
white hair lent him a venerable expression that
was hardly borne out by his massive shoulders and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
athletic figure, for they had not the faintest suspicion
of age.</p>

<p>“By Jove!” said the Optimist in enthusiastic
tones, “that old boy’s been a player in his day. In
the fifties he practically beat the Players single-handed
more than once. In fact, the old buffers
say at Lord’s that for three years he was the best
amateur bowler that there’s ever been. Of course
wickets have altered since his time, but up at
Lord’s they swear that Spofforth at his best was
never in it with ‘the Reverent.’”</p>

<p>“’Don’t wonder then,” said I, “that this Clerk
in Holy Orders has got such a devil of a family.
Look out, mind your heads!”</p>

<p>Captain George, of the Artillery, had chosen that
moment to open his shoulders to the youthful
T. S. M. with the result that a lovely skimming
drive dropped twenty yards in front of the pavilion
and bounced with a rattle on to the corrugated
iron roof. We had barely time to observe this
when a buzz of amazement went round the
crowded ring. It seemed that at last A. H., of
Middlesex, had “had a go” at one of the insidious
deliveries of Miss Grace, his sister, with the result
that he lifted her from the far net clean over the
ladies’ tent.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the Ancient, “they appear to be a
thoroughly amiable, courteous, carefully brought-up,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span> 
gentle-mannered family. There they go. It’s
H. C.’s turn now. He’s very nearly killed a little
boy. They seem to bowl like hell, and hit like
kicking horses!”</p>

<p>This brought misfortune to us in hard reality.
The General Nuisance strolled up with his permanent
simper.</p>

<p>“Oldknow,” said he, “unwillingly I heard the
profane utterance of your pagan mind. It is
grievous for a man of your parts and understanding
to give way to language of that character.
But you will be glad to hear that our
esteemed Secretary, Lawson, is suffering at this
moment from an attack of incipient paralysis. It
appears that that blackguard of a Billy is confined
to bed.”</p>

<p>“The brute!”</p>

<p>“The beast!”</p>

<p>“The pig!”</p>

<p>“What I we are actually left to face a team like
this with one bowler?” said I, the first to recover
from the shock.</p>

<p>“Don’t be in such a hurry,” said the General
Nuisance, with his geniality rising almost to the
point of hysteria. “We aren’t even left with one.
As a matter of fact we haven’t a bowler of any
sort. It’s true that we’ve any amount of the usual
small change. I can bowl three long hops and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
two full tosses in an over, so can you; so can
all of us; and that, dear friends, is what we’ve
got to do.”</p>

<p>“But you are forgetting Charlie,” said the
Optimist of the lion heart.</p>

<p>“Oh dear, no,” said the General Nuisance,
“’wouldn’t forget him for the world. If you
would only wait and let me break the news
with my usual delicacy. Charlie’s just wired to
say that his mother-in-law has been taken seriously
ill, and that he and Mrs. Charlie have been
obliged to go to town.”</p>

<p>Straightway the Ancient wheeled about, and fled—fled
with a curse into the recesses of the pavilion,
far from the madding crowd, the pitiless sun,
the perfect wicket, and those dreadful men from
Hickory loosening their arms.</p>

<p>“Tha-ank you! Tha-ank you!” called the bowler,
as a pretty little leg hit from J. P. Carteret struck
the inoffensive Optimist between the shoulder-blades.</p>

<p>“Comfort,” said I, addressing myself to the
General Nuisance, “if there had been the least
sense of propriety in that rotten played-out thing
called Providence, that ball had hit you on the
head.”</p>

<p>“Dear friends,” said the General Nuisance,
“don’t you think that Charlie’s mother-in-law
well maintains the traditions of her tribe?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>“The abandoned old woman!” cried I.</p>

<p>“Never mind, I think it’s our turn to win the
toss,” said the Optimist, unconquered still.</p>

<p>They ought to grant the Victoria Cross to men of
this heroic mould, who remain wholly invincible
to circumstance. Some credit was due to me as
well, for I had the presence of mind to behave as
custom, nay, etiquette, demands, when things are
going wrong. I broke out into loud and prolonged
abuse of the harmless necessary Secretary.</p>

<p>“Lawson is an utter and consummate ass!”
said I. “A man with the intelligence of an owl
would surely know that his bowlers were bound to
let him down at the eleventh hour. They always
do. They always consult their own book before
they think about their side. I shall suggest at
the next meeting of committee that Lawson be
asked to resign. Nature never designed a fool to
be a secretary; besides, one looks for foresight in
a secretary. Here he’s actually not made the least
provision for a case of this sort, which a man with
the penetration of the common hedgehog would
have anticipated at the beginning of the season.
And, Comfort, what’s he doing now? Surely he
knows that Middlesex aren’t playing, and of
course he’s had the sense to wire for Hearne and
Albert Trott.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>“No, I believe not,” drawled the General
Nuisance; “but we must give credit, my dear
Dimsdale, where credit’s due, for even that submerged
Secretary of ours has, impossible as it may
appear, gone one better than even your intelligence
suggests. He’s just cabled to Australia for Jones
and Trumble. They’re not so well known to the
Hickory cracks as Jack Hearne and Trott; besides,
they’ve been resting all the winter, don’t you
know.”</p>

<p>Here the pavilion bell pealed lustily as a signal
for the ground to clear immediately, it being now
within a few minutes of eleven o’clock. It was a
real relief that our conversation with the General
Nuisance had at length been interrupted, since I
for one could feel a quantity of awful consequences
fairly itching in my finger-tips. If nature
had not a habit of going out of its way to
encourage original sin in all its phases, the
General Nuisance must have died with a jerk at
a comparatively early period of his development.</p>

<p>The summons was promptly obeyed. The
players came trooping in from the remote corners
of the playing-piece; and it was observed that
while Hickory walked confident, lusty, and obtrusively
cheerful, Little Clumpton were in that
state of nerves when strong men pluck at their
moustaches and their ties. When we entered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
the dressing-room we found the Captain and the
Secretary conferring together in tragic whispers.
This in itself was sufficient to strike a chill into the
boldest heart; and we stood apart out of pure
respect and appreciation for the solemn sight.
Presently the Captain rose, and a shudder went
through us all, for we saw by his intense expression
that he was going out to toss. And we remembered
that the Captain was the unluckiest man in England
with the spin; that he had won the toss against
Hickory last year; that our so-called bowling was
absolutely unworthy of the name; that the wicket
was perfection; and that the finest batting side
that had ever appeared for Hickory was drinking
stone-ginger beer and cracking rude jokes in their
dressing-room across the way.</p>

<p>Alas, no jokes and ginger beer for Little Clumpton!
Even the Humourist forbore to make a pun;
the Optimist was silent as the tomb; and two
large-hearted persons sat on the face of the
General Nuisance, partly in the public interest, and
partly that manslaughter might be averted for a
time. When the Captain, pale but stern, went
forth to toss, the Worry tottered from his seat and
softly closed the door. We had no desire for publicity.
As for the preliminaries and suspense of the
sacred rite itself, in that direction madness lay.
The Pessimist alone dared to interrupt the holy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
peace that pervaded this dull and miserable dressing-room;
but he was a man without any of life’s
little delicacies, and utterly devoid of the higher
instincts and the finer feelings.</p>

<p>“I say, you men,” said he, “we might be a set of
Hooligans riding to the assizes in Black Maria to
make the acquaintance of Mr. Justice Day. Why
doesn’t somebody smile? Suppose you try,
Brightside, as you’re always such a jolly cheerful
sort o’ Johnny.”</p>

<p>“Shut up,” said the Secretary, “if you desire
to avoid what’s happened to that blasted Comfort!”</p>

<p>This pointed reference appeared to touch the
General Nuisance in his <i>amour propre</i>, for after
a violent struggle he was able to sufficiently disengage
his mouth from the vertebral columns of
his guardians to painfully suggest:—</p>

<p>“S’pose I give—compliments—club—to—Grace
Trentham and ask her to come and—bowl a bit—for
Lil Clumpton. She can—give such—a long
start—to—the refuse we’ve——”</p>

<p>Here, however, his custodians, by half garrotting
him, and the judicious application of Merryweather’s
“barn door,” were able to get their
refractory charge in hand again.</p>

<p>And now the door opened softly, and the Captain
stalked in, saying nothing. The fell deed was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
accomplished. Yet who was going in, not one of
us knew, and not one of us had the courage to
inquire. Those inscrutable eyes and that high
expansive brow were as impassive as the Sphinx.
Not a muscle twitched, not a line relented in the
Captain’s face, and not a man of us dared frame
the ingenuously simple question:—</p>

<p>“Halliday, have you won the toss?”</p>

<p>We noted the Captain’s smallest movements now
with wild-eyed anxiety. We saw him wash his
hands, we saw him part his hair, and when he
said: “Chuck me that towel, Lennox,” in sepulchral
tones, his voice startled us like an eighty-one
ton gun. Then he proceeded to divest himself of
his blazer. “We are fielding!” flashed through our
inner consciousness; but—but he <i>might</i> be going
in first. He rolled his sleeves up with horrible deliberation.
Oh, why had not that wretched Lawson,
miserable Secretary as he was, the pluck to
say: “Halliday, have you won the toss?” Surely
it was the Secretary’s place to do this, else what
was the good of having a Secretary if he couldn’t
ask the Captain who was going in, and simple
things of that sort?</p>

<p>The Captain hung his blazer up reflectively on
one of the pegs of his locker; he foraged in his
cricket bag; he drew forth a pair of pads. “He’s
taking wicket!” was the thought that made our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
flesh creep, since he had been known to undertake
these thankless duties on very great occasions.
But—but he <i>might</i> be going in first. And at least
he might have had the common humanity to put
us out of our misery. He had buckled on one pad,
and was carefully folding his trousers round his
ankle prior to adjusting the second, when he looked
up sadly and addressed me familiarly by name.</p>

<p>“Dimsdale,” he said slowly and meekly, “have
you any very rooted disinclination to going in first
with me?”</p>

<p>The Secretary jumped up and literally fell
upon the Captain’s neck. The General Nuisance
was immediately released. The Optimist and
the Pessimist were as brothers, identified in joy.
The Worry amused himself in a quiet way by
turning cart-wheels across the floor. Indeed, it
was a moment when life was very good.</p>

<p>Now the honour was so stupendous that had
been conferred upon me, that it was more than a
young and ambitious man with his name to make
could realize at first. It was beyond my most
highly-tinted dreams that I should be singled out
to go in first with the Captain in my first Little
Clumpton <i>v.</i> Hickory. Why should I, of all the
talented men our team possessed, be chosen for this
distinction? Was there not the Humourist, with
his dauntless “never-saw-such-bowling-in-my-life<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
air”; the Pessimist, who had played for the county
twice this season; the Ancient, with all the weight
of his accumulated wisdom, his guile, and his experience;
the Worry, who if allowed to stay ten
minutes, neither men nor angels could remove; the
General Nuisance, too, who must have been an
almost superhuman bat to be allowed to play at
all? It was a moment of my life when I said
with all becoming modesty: “Thanks, old chap,”
and proceeded to put on my pads with hands that
trembled.</p>

<p>“First wicket, Ancient,” said the Captain, writing
down the order. It was wonderful how merry the
room had suddenly become: the buzz of tongues,
the whistling of the music of the music hall, the
Humourist working at his pun, the General
Nuisance veiling his satisfaction in gin and
ginger beer, all testified that cricket was a noble
sport, and that life was really excellent.</p>

<p>“I say, you men,” said the Captain, “remember
that our game’s to keep in. No risks, mind; no
hurry for runs, you know. We haven’t got a bit
of bowling, and somebody’s told ’em so.”</p>

<p>I was in the act of testing the handle of my bat,
when I recollected with a pang that I was minus my
Authentics. What should I do? William had not
appeared with its substitute, yet in a couple of
minutes I should be going in to bat on perhaps the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
biggest occasion of my career. Heaven knew I
was horribly nervous as it was, so nervous, that
when I thought of marching out to that wicket,
before that crowd, to face that bowling, I began to
desire a gentle death and a quiet funeral. It was
now five minutes past eleven, and still that confounded
William had not come! What <i>should</i> I
do? The more I thought of the Magdalen, the
Winchester, and the M.C.C., the more impossible
they became.</p>

<p>“Ready?” said the Captain.</p>

<p>“Ye—es,” said I; “q—quite ready.”</p>

<p>“Hickory aren’t out yet,” said the kind-hearted
Optimist, looking through the window.</p>

<p>“’Wonder why they don’t hurry,” said the
General Nuisance; “I can see that Dimsdale’s
positively trembling to get at ’em. Besides, the
umpires have been out quite five minutes.”</p>

<p>“They’re funking us,” said the Humourist.</p>

<p>Ah, these humourists, what lion hearts they’ve
got!</p>

<p>“Perhaps they are being photographed,” some
enlightened mind suggested.</p>

<p>The Worry opened the door, although I vainly
assured him that there really was no hurry, to have
a look at what Hickory were up to.</p>

<p>“Why,” said he breathlessly, “they’re playing
two wicket-keepers.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>Sure enough, two men with pads on stood conversing
in the doorway of their dressing-room, and
looking across at us.</p>

<p>“’Never heard of such a thing before,” said the
Secretary, with a puzzled air, “as a side having
two wicket-keepers. H.C. must be a blooming
hurricane. But I’m not quite sure whether this
is altogether legal. Who’s got a copy of the rules?”</p>

<p>“Why, what are you fellows up to?” demanded
Captain George from the other side, gazing
earnestly at Halliday’s pads and mine.</p>

<p>“The very thing I want to ask you,” said
Halliday.</p>

<p>“We’re waiting for you to take the field,” said
Trentham; “the umpires have been out some
time.”</p>

<p>“We are quite ready when you are,” said
Halliday.</p>

<p>“<i>We’ve</i> been ready the last five minutes.”</p>

<p>“Then why don’t you go out?”</p>

<p>“How can we go out until you are in the
field?”</p>

<p>The position of Halliday’s jaw announced that
he was completely at a loss.</p>

<p>“Anyway,” said he, “what are Elphinstone and
Archie doing with their pads on?”</p>

<p>“<i>We</i> want to know why you two have got yours
on?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>“I told you we should go in,” said our Captain.</p>

<p>“But I said that we should,” said theirs.</p>

<p>“But I thought you were joking.”</p>

<p>“And I thought you were.”</p>

<p>“But I won the toss.”</p>

<p>“Pardon me, Halliday, but I won the toss.”</p>

<p>“Pardon me, Trentham, but you are quite
wrong.”</p>

<p>“My dear Halliday, this is absurd!”</p>

<p>“Well, who called?”</p>

<p>“Hanged if I know; but I know I won the toss.
But who did call?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know; but I’m certain that I won the
toss.”</p>

<p>A howl of laughter broke from the light-minded
persons in the other room. But on our part we
preserved a very religious gravity, I can assure
you. The dismay that had seized the whole team
was terrible to contemplate.</p>

<p>“Well, who saw us toss?” said their Captain
confidently.</p>

<p>“Yes; who saw us toss?” said ours, with an
equally full-toned conviction.</p>

<p>Yet, unhappily or happily, sure I know not
which, neither side could produce a single witness.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>What was to be done? The crowd was growing
highly impatient, and cries of “Play up!” assailed
us as we stood and argued.</p>

<p>“I don’t think there’s anything in the rules that
provides for both sides going in to bat,” drawled
the General Nuisance; “therefore, suppose we send
in a man, you send in a man; you have a bowler
on at one end, we have one on at the other, and all
field? That practically obviates the difficulty,
doesn’t it? And it’ll be ever so much nicer for
everybody.”</p>

<p>Though this solution was hailed by us as the
height of ingenuity, and “nice” to the last degree,
singularly enough Hickory were blind to its
beauties. Therefore when our Captain said, “We’d
better toss again, hadn’t we?” it struck George
Trentham that this was a rather good idea.</p>

<p>This time, that there might be no mistake, both
sides crowded round their irresponsible skippers.
Hickory had a tendency to view the thing as the
finest joke they’d ever heard, but Little Clumpton
to a man wore a funereal gravity. Trentham produced
a coin, and sent it spinning to the ceiling.</p>

<p>“Tails!” cried our Captain.</p>

<p>The coin dropped on the wooden boards of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
pavilion, and proceeded to run round on its edges,
as though enjoying the proceedings thoroughly,
whilst several enterprising men ran round after it.</p>

<p>“Tails it is!” said Lawson, who always arrived
just a short head before everybody else.</p>

<p>“Then I think,” said our Captain, with a most
statesmanlike deliberation, “all things considered,
we shall be justified in going in.”</p>

<p>A minute later Hickory streamed into the field,
and were greeted with great cheering. And as they
issued forth the breathless William appeared with
Thornhill’s cap, just in the nick of time.</p>

The Cussedness of Cricket</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">HAD I been in less of a tottering funk, I might
have taken the admirably timed arrival of
the Authentics as an omen of good luck. But I
was in that suicidal frame of mind when a man
wishes that he is anything but what he is, anywhere
but where he is, and that he has to do
aught but what he has to do. It is a frame of
mind that can give for deep-seated torture a
long start to nightmares, weddings, sea-sickness,
and public speaking. If I were only going in first
wicket, I shouldn’t care! If I’d only an inkling of
what the bowling was like! If only it wasn’t Little
Clumpton <i>v.</i> Hickory! If only the crowd wasn’t
so beastly big and demonstrative! If only it wasn’t
such a glaring hot day! If only this abject cap
was not two sizes too small! If it was only my
own, and it didn’t look and feel so supremely
ridiculous! If I could only cut away to a prompt
and very private death! Cricket is quite a gentle,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
harmless game, but he is a lucky man who has
not to sweat some blood before he’s done with it.</p>

<p>“Ready, Dimsdale?” said the Captain.</p>

<p>I followed him sickly, fumbling at my batting-glove
with nervous fingers.</p>

<p>“Wish you luck, old man,” said some person of
benevolent disposition, as I issued forth. It is never
exactly kind, however, to wish luck to the keenly
sensitive, as it leads them to think that they’ll
certainly need luck, and plenty of it, if they’re
going to stay long. From the Artistic Standpoint
(capital letters, please, Mr. Printer!), it is a thousand
pities that I cannot say that when I stepped
from the pavilion on this great occasion to open the
innings with my Captain, a man whose name had
penetrated to the remotest corners of the cricket
world, I held my head up with an air of conscious
power. Why was I not, as the Hero of this story,
prepared to do the thing in style, in the manner of
the most accepted writers? Of course I ought to
have marched to the wicket, my heart big with
courage, calm in the knowledge that the Hero never
does get less than fifty. I ought to have been ready
to chastise Villainy in the person of the Demon
Bowler, by hitting his length balls for six on the
slightest provocation. I am sure that no less than
this is expected of me by every right-minded
reader. Nor am I blind by any means to my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
obligations; yet somehow it is so much easier to
get runs with the pen than with the bat. At least
I have always found it so!</p>

<p>I daresay that, except for being a trifle pale,
I looked quite happy to all but the trained observer.
I don’t suppose that ten persons of the
shouting thousands present had the faintest notion
that the trim-built chap of medium height who
walked in with H. J. Halliday, his bat tucked
beneath his arm, as he fastened on his glove, had
limbs of paper and a heart of fear. There was
nought to indicate that there was a dreadful buzzing
in his ears, a black mist before his eyes, that
his knee-joints were threatening to let him down at
every step, and that he was praying to be bowled
first ball, to be put out of his misery at once.</p>

<p>When you go in to bat, it is not that you dread
aught special and particular. You would cheerfully
endure anything rather than your present ordeals.
You are not afraid of getting a “duck.” On the
contrary, you’ll be almost happy if you get one.
It is the mere sensation of an impending something,
you know not what, that plays skittles with
your impressionable nature.</p>

<p>“’Mind taking first ball, Halliday?” I said
hoarsely.</p>

<p>“If you like,” said he; then added, “Just play
your usual, and you’re bound to get ’em.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>True cricketers are the soul of kindness.</p>

<p>Carefully noting at which end the wicket-keeper
was, I just as carefully went to the one at which he
was not. The mighty H. C. Trentham was loosening
his arm, and sending down a few preliminaries.
I watched him as keenly as the black mists before
my eyes allowed. He brought his long brown arm
right over with a beautiful, easy, automatic swing.
The ball slipped from his fingers at an ordinary
pace, but as soon as it took the ground it spun off
the pitch with an inward twist at three times the
rate one would expect. He looked every inch a
bowler, powerfully built in every part, his body
supple as a cat’s, a remarkable length of limb, and,
better still, a pair of extremely strong and heavy-timbered
legs.</p>

<p>However, the man preparing to resist him looked
every inch a batsman, too. Lithe, alert, calm, he
seemed quietly happy that he had got to face a
bowler worthy of his artifice. The manner in
which he asked for his guard, and took it, the
elaborate process he went through to ensure the
maintenance of “two leg,” the diligent way in
which he observed the placing of the field, and the
freedom with which he ordered the screen about,
all pointed to the conclusion that if Hickory got
him out for under fifty on that wicket, they would
be able to congratulate themselves. There is as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
much difference between the first-class cricketer
and the ordinary club-man as there is between a
professional actor and the gifted amateur. The
club-man may be a marvel of conscientiousness,
discretion, and enthusiasm, and able to recite Steel
and Lyttelton from the preface to the index at a
moment’s notice, but he has not that air of inevitableness
that emphasizes the county man scoring
off the best of Briggs and Richardson, and apparently
able to compass any feat in the batting
line but the losing of his wicket.</p>

<p>The terrific H. C. Trentham was now ready to
deal destruction. Anxiously had I observed the
placing of the field, the most noticeable items of
which were the wicket-keeper standing a dozen
yards behind the sticks, and the four men in the
slips still deeper, with their hands on their thighs,
and their noses on a level with the bails. The
bowler measured his distance, and scratched up the
turf at his starting-point. The batsman set himself.
The bowler walked a couple of yards, then
broke into a trot, that gradually grew into a run,
and when he arrived at the crease, with the velocity
of a locomotive he hurled the ball from his hand,
and his body after it, almost faster than the eye
could follow. The Captain fairly dug his bat into
his block-hole, and the ball came back straight
down the pitch, whizzing and rotating in half-circles.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span> 
It was a most determined and barefaced
attempt to “york” the captain, and the bowler
smiled all over his countenance in a very winning
manner. The Captain set himself again. The next
ball was of perfect length, a few inches on the off,
and turned in suddenly, with the ungenerous idea of
hitting the top of the off stump; but the Captain,
watching it all the way, met it very warily, his right
leg well against his bat, and blocked it gently back
again to the bowler. The third had a very similar
design, but happening to be pitched a little farther
up, it came back as though propelled from a gun.
The bowler neatly picked it up one hand, and drew
the first cheer from the crowd. The fourth was
full of guile. It was a trifle on the short side, wide
of the off stump, and instead of turning in, was
going away with the bowler’s arm. The Captain
drew himself erect, held up his bat, and never made
the least attempt to play it. The bowler smiled
more winningly than ever. A London critic unburdened
his mind by shouting “Nottingham!”
The fifth was wickedness itself. The bowler covered
his fifteen yards of run with exactly the same action
and velocity, hurled down the ball with the same
frantic effort of arms and body, but, behold, the ball
was as slow as possible, and the eye could distinctly
follow it as it spun in the air with a palpable leg-bias.
Even the great batsman who had to receive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
it was at fault. He played a little bit too soon, but,
happily for Little Clumpton, the ground was so
hard and true that it refused to take the full amount
of work, and instead of its curling in and taking the
Captain’s middle, as the bowler had intended, it refused
to come in farther than the leg stick, which
was conscientiously covered by the Captain’s pad.
There it hit him, and rolled slowly towards the
umpire, whilst the wicket-keeper pelted grotesquely
after it.</p>

<p>“Come on!” I cried, seizing the opportunity, for
I was very, very anxious for the Captain to take
first over from the other end. Accordingly, we
scuttled down the pitch, and I got home just as the
wicket-keeper threw down my citadel.</p>

<p>“Well bowled, Charlie!” said the Captain. But
I think there was more in this than may appear,
as I believe the thoughtful Captain wished to attract
my careful attention to that particular ball.
Meantime the bowler had been grinning so violently
at his own exceeding subtlety that mid-off politely
requested him not to commit such an outrage on
the handiwork of nature.</p>

<p>“Tom, you have a try that end,” said Captain
George, throwing the ball to T. S. M. “Set the
field where you want ’em.”</p>

<p>“Left-hand round the wicket!” the umpire announced
to the batsman; “covers ’em both, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>It was plain, by the irregular arrangement of
the field, which had three men out, that T. S. M.
was slow.</p>

<p>“You don’t want a third man; send him out
into the country, and bring point round a bit!”</p>

<p>Now as these commands were issued most distinctly
from the top of the coach, and as Miss Grace
Trentham was at that moment the sole occupant of
the same, she must be held responsible for them.
A wide smile flickered in the face of every fielder,
including that of the happy-go-lucky Hickory
captain. But let it be observed, in passing, that
there are captains to whom this advice, however
Pallas-like, would not appear “good form.” It
was evident that Miss Grace knew her man.</p>

<p>“By Jove! she’s right,” said the good-humoured
soldier; “get round, Jimmy.”</p>

<p>“She always is,” said the Harrow captain, her
youngest brother; “and I wish she wasn’t. She
knows a jolly sight too much.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t she qualify for Kent,” said J. P.
Carteret, as he waddled off to deep square-leg.</p>

<p>The Harrow boy began with a singular sort of
movement that must have had a resemblance to
the war-dance of the cheerful Sioux, or the festive
Shoshanee, which developed into a corkscrew kind
of action that was very puzzling to watch, and
imparted to the ball a peculiar and deceptive flight.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
He was quite slow, with a certain amount of spin
and curl. The Captain played right back to him
every time, and, like the old Parliamentary hand
he was, there was very little of his wicket to be
seen, as his legs did their best to efface it. The
Captain had come in with the determination to take
no liberties. He meant to play himself thoroughly
well in before turning his attention to the secondary
matter of making runs. If T. S. M. had been a
Peate, his first over could not have been treated
with a more flattering respect. The consequence
was that he opened with a maiden also.</p>

<p>My turn had now arrived. I was called on to
face the finest amateur bowler in England. Judging
by the one over of his that I had had the privilege
of witnessing, he appeared to combine the pace
of a Kortright with the wiles of a Spofforth.
Taking him altogether, he did not seem to be the
nicest bowler in the world for a man of small experience
and ordinary ability to oppose. But I
remembered vaguely that the wicket was perfection,
and that a straight bat would take a lot of
beating. Besides, the black mists had lifted somewhat
from my eyes, and the beastly funk had considerably
decreased, as it often does when one is
actually at work. All the same, I took my guard
without knowing exactly what I did; I observed
the field without knowing precisely how it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
arranged, yet could see enough of it to be aware
that point was looking particularly grim, and half
inclined to chuckle, as though saying to himself,
“Oh, he’s a young ’un, is he?”</p>

<p>It was perhaps the sardonic countenance of point
that stirred the old Adam in me, for suddenly I took
heart of grace, recollected the Captain’s “Play your
usual, and you’re bound to get ’em,” and made up
my mind to play out at H. C. Trentham as though
my life depended on it. All the same, I could have
wished that the cap I wore was my own, and not
two sizes smaller than it should be, and that I
could divest my brain of Miss Grace’s sinister remark
anent Charlie’s arm getting over the screen,
at the end at which (doubtless at her suggestion) he
had gone on to bowl. Besides, he was grinning in
a way that, though surely very self-satisfied and
ridiculous, was disconcerting to a high degree. I
certainly think that if in the umpire’s opinion a
bowler takes too great liberties with his face at
any period of his delivery of the ball, the said
umpire should be empowered to “no-ball” the said
bowler. Probably the counties will petition M.C.C.</p>

<p>I planted my right foot on the edge of the crease
with mathematical care, and set myself to meet
the best bowler at either ’Varsity since Sammy
Woods. My straining eyes never left him for an
instant as he picked the ball up, worked his thumb<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
up and down the seam, rubbed it on the ground,
and then walked jauntily to his starting-point. I
could see him all the way; the beautiful clear sunlight,
the bright new red ball, and my own intentness
almost enabled me to read the maker’s
name on the cover as he held it in his hand whilst
he walked, trotted, galloped to the crease. As he
brought his arm high over his head, despite the
cessation of the screen’s assistance, I could see
the thumb and two fingers in which he grasped
the ball and every bit of his powerful wrist work.
I had no time to think or to know where the ball
was, however. But as it came humming from his
hand instinct said, “Go forward hard!” and forward
I went, leg, bat, and elbow, for all that I
was worth. There was a delicious vibration that
told me the ball was timed to the second full in the
middle of the bat. It flew like a streak to mid-off
all along the carpet; but mid-off happened to be
a county man, and it was back in the bowler’s
hands and threatening the Captain’s wicket just
as “No!” had left my mouth. And there was a
personal compliment implied in the blinking eyes
of H. C. Trentham and the benevolent smile of
H. J. Halliday that was a recompense for all the
pains I was enduring and many hours of “duck”-requited
toil. I was conscious of an elated thrill
running through my fibres as I awaited number<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
two. Again I watched it eagerly as it came spinning
through the sunlight and humming like a
top; again I could not say exactly where it was,
but out went bat, and leg, and elbow as before, and
mid-off was afforded another opportunity for the
exhibition of his skill. I set myself defiantly for
number three. Let H.C. Trentham bowl his heart
out. The third came along humming, and whizzing,
and spinning in the manner of the other two,
but I had a vague sort of idea that it was a little
wider and a little farther up. It was faster than
an express train, but it merely appeared to delicately
kiss the middle of the bat in the gentlest,
sweetest way.</p>

<p>“Oh, well hit!” came the voice of the Captain
down the wicket. The crowd broke into a roar,
and in a perfect ecstasy I looked into what I
guessed should be the direction of the ball. Behold!
there was cover-point on the verge of the
boundary waiting whilst a spectator officiously
returned it. It was merely the force of habit
that was responsible for that fourer, but the
sensation of pure rapture was incomparable. As
there is nothing in the whole range of poetry or
prose with which to point a parallel, it must be
allowed that beside a perfectly-timed boundary hit,
on a hard ground, from fast bowling, all other
delights of this life are as nothingness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>The fourth ball came along in much the same
way as the third, yet was appreciably shorter and
slower. I left it severely alone. The fifth was a
regular uprooting yorker, but I got my bat down
in time and chopped it away. So much for the
crack’s first over. I had broken my duck in the
most handsome manner; I could see the ball; I
was beginning to feel alarmingly happy; I never
felt so fit and so much like making runs. And I
had only to continue as I’d started to be sure of
a trial for the county next week against Somerset.
But I must restrain my eagerness, play steady, and
keep cool.</p>

<p>The Captain adopted the same tactics of masterly
inactivity in regard to the second over of
the youthful T.S.M. He was quite an ordinary
club bowler compared to his great brother at the
other end. A shortish one was hooked quietly
round to leg for a single, and it was my turn to
meet him. There was not a hint of my previous
vacillation in the way I took my guard. The
buzzing in my head had altogether gone; my eye
was as clear and keen as possible. I had had my
baptism of fire already. This was very common
stuff; indeed, so much so that I took the liberty
of turning the second ball I had of it to leg for
three.</p>

<p>It being the last ball of the over, I had again<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
to face H. C. With a bowler of his quality it
requires a man of very great inexperience to be
quite at ease or to think of attempting liberties.
Therefore, again I concentrated the whole of my
attention on every ball; and the billiard-table pitch
and a straight, unflinching bat enabled me to cope
with his second over. It was a maiden, but it
called for brilliancy on the part of mid-off, and a
magnificent bit of fielding by Carteret in the slips,
who saved a keen late cut from being a boundary
to make it one. Each ball was timed to the
instant; my wrists and the rare old blade with
the wrapping at the bottom seemed to be endowed
with magic; the sun was just in the right place;
I had forgotten all about my cap, the screen, the
might of the attack—forgotten everything but the
joy of achievement, so supreme was the sense of
making runs with certainty and ease from county
bowling, in the presence of an appreciative crowd,
on a great occasion. Here was Elysium. It was
a sufficient recompense for a hundred failures. If
I kept playing this game I couldn’t help but get
’em. Fifty was assured, perhaps; who knew——?
But no man can be sanguine in regard to his first
century. That is a bourn that few travellers
ever reach.</p>

<p>The Captain played T. S. M. gently for another
single. I trotted down blithely to the other end.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
He was still bowling his slow leg-breaks, but it
would be folly to attempt to drive him, as his flight
was so deceptive; besides, he had three men out.
One ball which he delivered a full two yards behind
the crease was tossed up so high that it was difficult
to resist, as it appeared to be almost a half-volley
at first sight. It actually dropped shorter
than his others, however. This was the ball
with which he usually got his wickets; and
although, crude as it was, it might do well enough
for schoolboys, it was to be hoped that he didn’t
expect a man who intended to appear next week
for his county to fall a victim to it! If he did, he
would very probably be disappointed. The feel
of that three to leg was still lingering in my wrist,
and I was certain that this stroke could be played
with impunity on this wicket. Besides, it would
show the Captain at the other end that I was by
no means content to follow his lead, but had resources
of my own. Again, if I persevered in
getting T. S. M. away to leg, he would be certain
to pitch them up a bit, and if he could only be
persuaded to do that, sure as fate I should go out
to him and lift him clean over the ring! It wasn’t
such a very big hit; besides, I felt capable of doing
anything with ordinary club bowling. Really, I
never felt so fit, and on such excellent terms with
everybody and everything! When I received the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
first ball of T. S. M.’s next over I had a plan of
the positions of the on-side fielders in the corner of
my eye. But it was such an excellent length that
I had to play defensively. To my infinite pleasure,
I immediately saw that the second was his usual
shortish one. I promptly prepared to help myself
to another three, stepped into my wicket so to do,
but was so anxious to seize my opportunity that
I had not troubled to note exactly how short it was.
Therefore it rose a little higher than I expected,
and I was also a little bit too soon. It hit me just
above the pad with an almost caressing gentleness.</p>

<p>“How <i>was</i> that?” said the bowler, turning
round to the umpire.</p>

<p>This didn’t bother me in the least. I merely felt
a trifle annoyed that my ardour had caused me to
let off so bad a ball. But my pleasant meditations
were suddenly disturbed by adjacent voices,—</p>

<p>“Chuckerrupp!”</p>

<p>It never entered my head that I could be out by
any possibility. The ball was a very vulgar long
hop. I looked at the umpire with an air of bewilderment.
He had a stolid solemnity that was
funereal. I saw his hand go up. Thereon, with
the blood buzzing into my ears, I made tracks
for the pavilion. All the way I went I could not
realize that I was out. My only sensation was the
not unpleasing one of walking swiftly. Dead<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
silence reigned as I marched in head down, thinking
of nothing in particular. But the vision of
the umpire’s upthrown hand seemed to be painted
on my retina.</p>

<p>The Ancient was in the dressing-room brandishing
his bat.</p>

<p>“Rough luck, old man!” he said.</p>

<p>Thereupon he went out to take my vacant place
at the wicket, while I sat down, slowly mopped
my wet face, rinsed my parched mouth, and then
proceeded to take my pads off in the dullest, most
apathetic manner.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br>

Of a Young Person in Brown Holland</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">I &#160;WAS still seated, striving to break to myself
the news that I really must be out, and that
my brave dreams were as dust, when the man I
least desired to see—the General Nuisance—appeared
with his condolence. He placed a shilling
in my hand with an air of indescribable tenderness.</p>

<p>“What’s this for?” I said.</p>

<p>“For your cricket outfit,” said he. “I knew
that you’d wish to dispose of it at once by private
treaty, as you’ll never touch a bat again if you live
to be a hundred. A shilling for the lot, and a
pretty liberal offer.”</p>

<p>When I slowly raised my face and looked at the
General Nuisance, there was that within it which
caused him to somewhat hurriedly remember that
he had “got to see a man about a dog,” and he,
therefore, could not possibly stay just then to
discuss the details. The utterly abandoned appear
to enjoy a charmed existence. It was the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
at the wicket. I’ve seen the General Nuisance
dropped more times in one afternoon than men
who have had their moral natures properly developed
are in the course of a season.</p>

<p>Having convinced myself at last that I was
actually out, I got up and donned my blazer with
an assumption of sad-eyed resignation. A case of
l.b.w. offers no scope for original and forcible combinations
of phrase; it has exhausted them quite
a long time ago. Thus I filled a pipe, and began
pathetically to smoke. If it were not that the gods
gave tobacco to us to assuage our miseries, it is
certain that common humanity would insist on a
lethal chamber being attached to the pavilion of
every cricket-ground, whereby poor mortals placed
as I was now might not continue in their sufferings.</p>

<p>I eventually went out and sat down with as
much dignity as I could assume on the pavilion
front. There, staring me in the face, was the grim
legend, 10-1-7. Presently I found the courage to
look at the game. But it reminded me too acutely
of the horrid void left gaping in my young ambition.
How I could see the ball, and how absurdly
simple did the bowling look! It always
does when you’ve been in and got out for a few.
If you’ve been in and made a score, it is usual to
advise your successors to play a watchful game, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
the bowling is by no means so easy as it seems.
Why didn’t the Ancient cut that ball for four,
instead of pecking at it? Why didn’t the Captain
jump into those ridiculous donkey-drops and hit
’em to the moon, instead of playing back and
contenting himself with singles? It was this pottering,
afternoon-tea kind of cricket that was ruining
the game.</p>

<p>The team agreed that they had never seen me
shape so well. But what solace is it to be told
this when one is out for seven? Here was I
fitness incarnate, timing and seeing the ball to a
hair, condemned to sit hours on the hard seat of
that pavilion, eating my heart out with inactivity,
while others got ’em. Verily cricket is a cheerful
pastime! The perfect wicket, the glorious day, the
appreciative crowd, the chance of fame, and then
l.b.w. 7.</p>

<p>“Of course, the ball did a lot,” said the Pessimist.
“’Wouldn’t have hit the wicket by a mile. Your
leg couldn’t possibly have been in front, and, of
course in your humble opinion the blithering umpire
is either drunk or delirious.”</p>

<p>“Grimston,” said the Humourist, “you appear
to suffer from a deficient sympathy. It is very
unkind of you to make remarks of this sort, when
you can see that the poor fellow is in pain. It is
not humour and it is not humanity.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>There was no alternative but to continue smoking
with that placid indifference that alone can
cope with the vulgar, common wit that is levelled
at ourselves.</p>

<p>“Look at Brightside, lucky brute!” said the
Secretary, “jawing on the coach there with Miss
Grace. Keeps her all to himself, the selfish beggar!
instead of coming down and introducing us.”</p>

<p>The Optimist appeared to be having a particularly
happy time. He was seated beside Miss Grace
on the box-seat, talking in the most animated
manner, whilst she put down the runs in the
Hickory score-book, which she held on her knee.
It is impossible to assess the exact amount of envy
he provoked in the susceptible bosoms of his side
seated on the pavilion front.</p>

<p>We were still discussing the good fortune of the
Optimist, and watching him pursue it, when he
climbed down from his conspicuous position and
came along towards eight of his flannel-clad colleagues,
who had a terrible quantity of inflammable
material in their manly interiors.</p>

<p>“’Do believe he’s coming for us,” said the quick-eyed
Secretary. “S’pose he takes the bally team?”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it a good thing we’re so good-looking?”
said the Humourist.</p>

<p>“I really can’t help <i>my</i> personal appearance,”
said the General Nuisance, with a simper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>“Soap might,” I said coarsely. But my temperature
was very low.</p>

<p>The answer of the General Nuisance was very
properly taking the form of a naked fist; and I, on
my part, was just proposing to test the staying
powers of his singularly beautiful aquiline nose,
when the Optimist arrived and lifted up his voice.</p>

<p>“Dimsdale,” said he importantly, “Grace
Trentham wants to see you. She thinks your batting’s
prime. ’Says the way you stood up to
Charlie the perfection of style and confidence.
No end of a critic, I can tell you. ’Says your crack
to cover’s test thing she’s seen in that line since
Lionel Palairet’s off-drive. In fact, my son, I
rather think if you’ll come and be presented to her
you won’t be so very sorry. She wants to see
you awfully.”</p>

<p>The Optimist really was a very delightful person.
He spoke loud enough for all the team to hear.
Nor was he content to make a bald announcement
of my honours, but managed to embroider them
with an art that soured the uninvited for an hour.
It was remarkable how promptly the whole team
became occupied with other things. The Ancient
fluked H. C. wretchedly through the slips for three.</p>

<p>“Run it out!” they yelled, as though the match
depended on it. “Go on, Ancient! Get back, Jack!
Oh, well run! Well run!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>“Come on, Dimsdale,” said the Optimist, the
moment this riot subsided. “Let us get away from
these nasty, noisy cricketers, and go into more
refined society.”</p>

<p>“Have you noticed,” said the Pessimist to the
Treasurer, “how some men are never content
unless they are sitting beside something that’s
got a frock on? Never saw the fun myself
in uttering bland lies to insipid schoolgirls, to
estimate the amount of music in their ‘ohs’ and
‘reallys!’”</p>

<p>“Mind you men bat your very best,” said the
Optimist, as we departed, “then perhaps Grace
Trentham’ll send for some of you. Never know
your luck, you know, do you?”</p>

<p>“How gaudy!” growled the Secretary. “Great
encouragement to get runs.”</p>

<p>I felt this to be a moment of my middling unilluminated
life. But to show the Goddess that
Nature had designed me to support her favours
with due dignity, and, therefore, that her confidence
in me was not in the least degree misplaced,
I strove to walk modestly in my public
decorations. As we went to the coach the pent-up
enthusiasm of the Optimist broke forth.</p>

<p>“Tell you what, old chap,” he said, “she’s quite
the jolliest girl I know. One of the sort you read
about, you know. No end of a fine girl, I can tell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
you. Not a bit o’ side and small talk, and Society
manner, and that sort o’ rot. Awfully good people
too, the Trenthams. By Jove! old chap, if I could
only bat like you! If I’d only got your confidence,
and your nerve, and your wrist!”</p>

<p>“It’s awfully good of you, old man,” I said, with
a touch of complacency, I fear, “to bring me
along and give me a show, when you might have
kept her all to yourself.”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” said he. “Sent me to fetch you,
you know. Besides, you sat there looking so
deuced chippy that it struck us that you ought to
be made to buck up a bit.”</p>

<p>“H’m! Ah! yes!” I murmured.</p>

<p>The Optimist was one of the hopelessly good
sorts of the world, but he never did know when
to leave off. He should have remembered that a
woman’s admiration is one thing, but that her pity
is quite another. But, then again, how like the
good old Optimist to neglect his own opportunities!
He was not altogether blind to that side of the
question, though, since he said feelingly,—</p>

<p>“She says that Elphinstone and Carteret are
staying at the Rectory with her father.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said I, with the brutal directness of the
average man, “Carteret happens to be married,
and I saw in the <i>World</i> last week that Elphinstone’s
just got engaged.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>“That a fact!” he cried, with a fervour that gave
him away.</p>

<p>I regret to say that I laughed to myself in a
cynical manner.</p>

<p>“Grace, this is Mr. Dimsdale, whom you saw
batting just now,” said the Optimist, as we halted
under the drag. “Dimsdale, Miss Trentham,
whose brother got you leg before.”</p>

<p>“Awful fluke it was, too,” said the coach’s fair
occupant frankly, in the act of bowing; and then
added, “How do you? Won’t you come up? Heaps
of room, and you’ll see ever so much better.”</p>

<p>As she looked down at us, and we looked up at
her, I discovered with alarming suddenness that Miss
Grace Trentham had a pair of eyes of remarkable
beauty, large and clear, and very blue, indeed, with
long dark lashes drooping on her cheeks. She had
also the colouring that one only sees in the English
girl grown in the open air. In itself it was a
pastoral, as sweet as a mown hayfield in a sunny
June. It was of the purest light brown, not quite
dark enough for chestnut, but, as I happen to be a
promising batsman, and not a budding novelist, I
am utterly at a loss to describe exactly the kind of
tint I mean. Therefore, you must excuse my limitations,
particularly as you <i>may</i> find me playing
for the County one day, if I confess that the utmost
my literary art can do for Miss Grace Trentham’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
skin is to say that it most resembled in the richness
of its hue a cup of strong tea with plenty of
thick cream in it. She had heavy coils of hair
of a similar baffling shade, and a mischievous curl
or two that made her eyebrows laugh. She was an
early-morning girl, English to the bone, and clean
and limber as a thorough-bred. I should not have
suspected her of afterthoughts, and do not doubt
that had I asked her what her opinion was of
“Treasure Island,” she would have said without
the slightest hesitation, “Oh, isn’t it just ripping!”</p>

<p>When on her invitation we climbed to the seats
beside her, we found that she was scoring with
a diligence as wonderful as it was artistic. She
had two fountain pens—one of black ink, to put
down the runs; the other of red, to take the bowling
analysis.</p>

<p>“Awfully jolly pleased, Mr. Dimsdale, to see you
out so soon,” she said.</p>

<p>“Oh!” said I; my jaw fell.</p>

<p>“You were shaping a great deal too well, you
know,” she added.</p>

<p>My jaw resumed its normal position.</p>

<p>“You played Charlie like a book,” she said.
“Met him before?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” I said briskly.</p>

<p>“Then you batted real well,” she said. “For
Charlie’s the best bowler in England now that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
Tom Richardson’s stale. He’s top of the averages
this week. One hundred and fifty-five wickets for
13·83, and he’s certain to get another fifty before
the season’s done. At Lord’s he fairly had Oxford
on toast; they <i>were</i> in a frightful funk.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” I groaned; feebly adding to cover
my distress, “what one would call the bluest of
the blue, Miss Trentham.”</p>

<p>Miss Trentham transfixed me with a look of
whimsical enquiry. Then she said quickly:
“Oh, I’m <i>so</i> sorry I didn’t notice your cap.
Why weren’t you there to stop the rot? And why
didn’t you get your blue when you were up?
They only gave you a show in the Freshers’.”</p>

<p>“Nothing near good enough,” I said humbly.
But how the deuce did she know that I’d only
had a show in the Freshers’? I had yet to learn
that her full family title was Grace, the Walking
Wisden, because she was so well grounded in that
indispensable work that she could repeat even its
advertisements by heart.</p>

<p>“’Would be now, Grace, don’t you think?”
said the friendly Optimist.</p>

<p>“Ra-<i>ther</i>. His style’s O. K. He watches the
ball, too.”</p>

<p>“But it’s such a beautiful wicket,” said I. “You
can play forward at anything.”</p>

<p>“It <i>is</i> a good wicket,” she said, “but I could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
see you watching Charlie all the way. And that’s
where ’Varsity bats generally fail, don’t you know.
Seen dozens of ’em, blues too, and wonderful school
reputations, and all that, regular ‘lions on lawns.’
Put on ’em a Burroughes and Watts’, and they’ll play
like the Badminton. But just let the wicket begin
to ‘talk’ a bit, then it’s another story. Let me
see, were you not in the Winchester eleven?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said; “just got in.”</p>

<p>“You must have been well coached. I do like
to see a man look at the ball. Oh, was that a hit?
No; byes. Dear! dear! Edgcome is a dreadful muff
behind the sticks. Can’t take Charlie at all. Why
don’t he stand back farther? Or why don’t they
have a long-stop? All right, umpire!”</p>

<p>The umpire having waved his finger to signal
the byes, the scorer waved hers to show that she
had got them.</p>

<p>“Forty up!” she called down to the small boy
who was attending to “the telegraph.” “It’s
about time we had another wicket, don’t you
think?”</p>

<p>“We are all serene at present,” said the Optimist
cheerily. “I think Halliday’s about played
himself in, and there’s no man better worth
watching when he takes root. Oh! very pretty,
Jack. Run ’em out!”</p>

<p>He had just got one of H. C.’s fastest away<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
for three. A frown clouded the open countenance
of Miss Grace.</p>

<p>“Toddles,” she cried to the Rev. E. J. H. Elphinstone,
who was nearest to us in the out-field, “just
tell Charlie to tell George to take one of those men
out of the slips and put him for the draw. Oh,
and Toddles, tell him not too deep to save the
single. We’re going to give nothing away if <i>I</i>
can help it.”</p>

<p>“Why do they call him Toddles?” said I.</p>

<p>“’Cause his legs are so short,” she said curtly.
“Oh, and just look where he’s got his mid-on.
Toddles, tell him his mid-on wants to be straighter.
George may be a good old sort, and all that, but
he’s no more fit to be captain than he is to play
for England. But I should have thought Archie
<i>would</i> have known better.”</p>

<p>As I was at pains to subsequently explain to
those members of our side who were not privileged
to be sitting beside Miss Grace Trentham, it was
a most fascinating thing to observe her conducting
a highly technical and animated conversation,
ordering a team of county cricketers about with
some caustic comments on the same, scoring every
run, taking the analysis, and keeping her eye on
the small boy, “the telegraph,” and all the fine
points of the game.</p>

<p>“Mr. Dimsdale,” she said, after Captain George<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
had carried out the sedulously conveyed commands
of his sister, “Mr. Dimsdale, what were you about,
to get out to a long hop of my young brother
Tom’s? He can’t bowl a little bit. No length
no spin, no break, no devil, no anything. Plain
as print! Over-confidence, perhaps?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid it was,” I confessed.</p>

<p>“Great pity,” she said reflectively. “I should
rather have liked you to stay a bit; you’d have
been worth looking at. And I’ve just got my
doubts about that decision. L B W to left arm
round <i>is</i> always a bit fishy, isn’t it? Not, you
know, that I’m at all sorry that you’re out.
I’m Hickory, of course, and all that, although I
<i>do</i> like to see a man play the game. You see,
I’m sorry and I’m not sorry. Oh, hang it! I
can’t explain it!”</p>

<p>Both the Optimist and I had the ill manners
to smile with some breadth. But the solecism was
worth committing, if only for the sake of observing
the gleam of envy that ran along the row of
cricketers on the pavilion front. Weren’t we
enjoying ourselves! And they could have been
so much farther from the mark. I might never
have been leg before in my life.</p>

<p>“’Mustn’t get over-confident, you know, if
you’re going to make a first-rater,” Miss Grace
said authoritatively; “great mistake. But I believe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
you were not so <i>very</i> confident when you
first went in. In fact, I thought you were just—just
a wee bit nervous. I wouldn’t have minded
betting a shilling that Charlie did you first over.
Weren’t you a bit nervous?”</p>

<p>“Oh dear, no,” I said, resenting the imputation
with great robustness. “I’m never nervous.”</p>

<p>She was evidently a young person of the most
horrible penetration. What could have put these
ideas into her mind?</p>

<p>“Don’t you think,” she said suddenly, “that my
young brother Tom would get on better if he took
to playing marbles? His bowling is dreadfully
awful, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Of course it’s not so good as your brother
Charlie’s,” I said diplomatically.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” she said sardonically; “I’ll write
that down. But say, yes; I <i>do</i> want you to say, yes.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Well, you see, I maintain in the face of all my
people that it is absolute rubbish. They all think
he’s rather good for a boy. They say at Harrow that
he’s going to make another Dowson. But if that’s
so, it don’t take much to make a Dowson, does it?
Do, Mr. Dimsdale, please say that you think it’s
awful rot. It is, you know, really. And the
amount of side that boy’s got on is something
extraordinary. He might be the Old Man himself.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
Thinks himself no end of a swell ’cause he’s diddled
a few schoolboys with his donkey-drops. Never
saw such a length in my life. Why don’t George
shunt him and give Billington a try?”</p>

<p>Even as she spoke the captain, who was now
thoroughly set, was seen to gather himself for a
great effort. At last he ventured to have a go at
this severely criticised slow bowler. Up and up
went the ball a remarkable height, and, to the
horror of the Optimist and myself, we saw that it
must drop into the hands of the little parson just
below us on the boundary. We both held our
breaths in a spasm of suspense, but Miss Grace
seemed as happy as possible.</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” she said cheerfully; “Toddles’ll
have him. He never drops anything he can get
to; and he’s judging this to a ‘T.’ What a height
it is, though, and deceptive, too! He’ll have to go
back a bit now.”</p>

<p>Next instant a derisive howl broke from the
crowd. The little parson, famed the whole of
England over for his brilliancy and certainty at
third man and in the country, having slightly misjudged
the flight and height of the catch, had had
to go back in a hurry at the last moment, with the
result that his hands and body were in a very overbalanced
kind of position in which to receive the
ball. He had failed to hold it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>“Oh, Toddles! Toddles!” cried Miss Grace, in
agonized accents; “what <i>are</i> you doing?”</p>

<p>The relief of the Optimist and myself was such
that we must have hugged one another had we
not been in a place so public. Poor Miss Grace,
though, was perfectly crimson with mortification,
and we could fairly hear the tears in her voice as
she said with a sublime pathos, “He’ll get a hundred
now!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br>

Conversational</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“I ’LL never forgive that wretched Toddles!”
said Miss Grace. “It <i>was</i> careless of him.
It’s inexcusable for a county man to drop anything.
The little brute!”</p>

<p>“But, my dear Grace,” said the Optimist, kind
soul, who looked at everything from a humanitarian
standpoint, “the best men are liable to
err.”</p>

<p>“They shouldn’t be,” said Miss Grace fiercely,
“with the practice they get.”</p>

<p>“But human nature is fallible,” urged the Optimist
gently.</p>

<p>“I don’t care a pin about human nature!” said
Miss Grace, more fiercely than ever. “What’s
human nature got to do with cricket? Did that
miserable Toddles drop that catch, or did he not?
It’s simply disgraceful. I hate slovenly fielding.”</p>

<p>“It was a very difficult catch, though,” said the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
Optimist, still doing his best for the fallen favourite.
“Awful lot of spin on, and look at the height;
besides, the sun was in his eyes, and the flight
must have been dreadfully deceptive.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care about the spin,” said the inexorable
Miss Grace, “or the height, or the flight, or the
light, or the sight, or the anything. Toddles ought
to have had that catch. Jimmy Douglas ’ud have
had it in his mouth. And if your Captain does
get a hundred, I’ll give that wretched Toddles such
a talking to as he won’t forget in a hurry. You
can laugh, Mr. Dimsdale. It’s all right for you:
sixty-four and only one wicket down. We can’t
afford to give away a leg-bye on a wicket like
this.”</p>

<p>“But I never saw better ground-fielding than
Hickory’s to-day,” said I soothingly. Certainly
their fielding as a whole had been excellent.</p>

<p>“They know they’ve got to field when they play
for Hickory,” said Miss Grace sternly. “They
know better than to get slack. A man who won’t
field oughtn’t to be allowed to play. Every man
can field if he tries. Even poor old George has
to buck up when he plays for Hickory. He knows
that I simply won’t have it. He daren’t funk a
single one; and he has to get down to ’em with both
hands, rheumatism or no rheumatism. I’ll have
none of his Artillery tricks. Gave him an hour’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
practice this morning before we started, and by
the time he’s been here a month he’ll be quite a
reformed character. Look, he’s positively energetic.
Did you see his smart return. He knows
I’m watching him. Well fielded, George!”</p>

<p>As her clear voice rang out, the face of every
one of the eleven fielders lit up with a smile.</p>

<p>“That seems to please them,” said I slyly.
“I suppose you must be very chary with praise.”</p>

<p>“I have to be,” she said. “They take an awful
lot of bringing to the scratch. George says I’m a
regular martinet; and my young brother Tom says
I’m a confounded nuisance. But that’s his cheek,
of course; he’s an unlicked cub, don’t you see; he’s
got to go through the mill yet. Do you know,
Cheery [this apparently was a name of her own for
the Optimist], that I can’t stand these schoolboys
at all. My young brother Tom had quite a nice
little way of bringing two or three of the Harrow
eleven, and one or two other men of light and leading
from the other schools, down to the Vicarage.
Talk about ‘side,’ I never saw anything like it.
They wanted a Wisden all to themselves; and to
hear ’em talk you’d have thought that Stoddy
meant taking ’em all out with him in the autumn.
They thought Archie’s batting was ‘not so bad,’
and Charlie’s bowling ‘rather decent’; but what
a pity it was that I hadn’t seen Comery of Eton,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
and Prospect of Charterhouse. And they wouldn’t
have a few on our lawn because they thought it
a bad thing for their style. Style, indeed! their
style consists in jolly well going forward to every
jolly thing. And they didn’t bowl ’cause it was
too much fag; and there wasn’t much fun in fielding.
I told my old guv’nor pretty straight that
they’d have to clear out; and they had to. And
now I absolutely refuse to have ’em. No more
Harrow boys if I know it. One has to draw the
line somewhere, hasn’t one? Not that my young
brother Tom is half a bad sort, really. Of course
his side is something dazzling; but when he’s been
from school for about a week it begins to get some
o’ the gilt chipped off it. Don’t <i>quite</i> do, don’t you
know. Some of those other fellows’ sisters think
it just beautiful and admire it ever so. I don’t.
But I’m gradually getting my young brother Tom
to forget himself a bit. He don’t spread himself
now anything like he used to. I think we shall
lick him into shape, and make a county cricketer
of him after all. But he’ll have to roll up a different
sort o’ length to that. ’Nother boundary.
Halliday only wants two more for his fifty. Eighty
up, boy. Hullo! I see Archie’s beginning to look
a bit prickly. Doesn’t suit his book at all. Oh,
they’re going to change the bowling at last, are
they? Dear me, what intelligence! Who are they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
putting on? What, Swipes, with his awful stuff!
If they really <i>want</i> ’em to get runs why don’t
they put on Toddles? What with their fielding,
and their judgment, and their general knowledge
o’ the game, they’re simply giving this match
away. Eighty-two for one; what rot!”</p>

<p>Miss Grace’s annoyance was increasing in company
with the score. As the sting was extracted
from Hickory’s bowling, and it came in for severer
punishment, she grew particularly caustic in her
criticisms. And the greater her anger, the greater
her frankness, till presently she became a real delight
to sit and listen to. Before long the Optimist
and I were holding our sides for simple mirth.</p>

<p>“I don’t wonder at it,” she said; “must be no
end of a joke to you to see ’em tossing up this sort
of ‘tosh.’ And their fielding, too. Just look at the
wicket-keeper; why will he keep snapping ’em,
instead of waiting and taking ’em gently, like McGregor?
There, that’s Halliday’s fifty; I know he’ll
get his hundred. But don’t cheer, please. Look at
the luck he’s had. It’s too bad of that wretched
Toddles!”</p>

<p>Poor Miss Grace was almost tearful when her
mind reverted to that catastrophe. There was
undoubtedly a rod in pickle for the hapless Elphinstone.</p>

<p>“Ninety up. Really this is too bad!” cried she.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
“Charlie’s going off now; had a pretty long spell,
too. But they’ve only got thirty-one off him.”</p>

<p>“Fine bowler, isn’t he?” I said, trying to pour
oil on the troubled waters; “but he’s had no luck
this morning. Grand built chap as well.”</p>

<p>“Could do with a bit more head though,” said
his censorious sister, who seemed so severe a critic
that it struck me that it was a pity the Athenæum
did not know about her. She would have given
the sprouting novelists and spring poets some
talkings-to!</p>

<p>Runs were coming now with exhilarating frequency.
The Captain was beginning to score all
round the wicket, off anything they liked to send
him. There was no more dangerous or resourceful
bat in England when once he got his eye in. The
Ancient, too, was moving steadily in the direction
of his fifty. It would be idle to insist that he had
a pleasing style; indeed, he did not appear to have
a style of any kind. He had no physique, and you
might watch him get a hundred, and then wonder
how he’d got them, as he hadn’t a single stroke
worthy of the name. But there was no man on
the side who got runs with such striking regularity;
and when the meteors and comets had appeared
and disappeared, this ordinary fixed star
was still at the wickets, cocking ’em under his leg
for two and sneaking short ones. From time immemorial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
he had done the same. He had played
oftener in Little Clumpton <i>v.</i> Hickory than any
of the giants of the past, and with such an honourable
distinction that the aggregate of his runs
greatly excelled that of anybody else. How far
back in antiquity the Ancient had first enjoyed
his being, history never could determine. In
the Little Clumpton <i>v.</i> Hickory of twenty years
ago, when the Ancient made 64 not out, and pulled
the match out of the fire, tradition said that he
looked even older than he looked to-day; and his
manner was so perennially youthful, too, that it
was not until he took his cap off, that one would
have guessed he was a patriarch. Men might
come and men might go, but he went on for ever.</p>

<p>“Hundred and ten up,” called Miss Grace.</p>

<p>“How many’s Oldknow got?” the Optimist inquired.</p>

<p>“Why, he’s actually got thirty-three!” she said,
in a startled tone. “How <i>has</i> he got them? I’m
waiting to see him make a decent stroke. But he
don’t edge ’em, and he don’t fluke ’em, and he
don’t give chances, and he don’t look as though
they’ll bowl him in a year. Thirty-three? Isn’t it
marvellous? He can’t bat a bit, though, can he?”</p>

<p>“Oh no, not a bit,” said I; “at least, that’s what
everybody says. No one ever thinks anything of
Oldknow’s batting, but if there’s runs to be got<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
Oldknow always considers it his duty to get ’em.
For the last ten years his average for Little Clumpton
has panned out at forty-six, and since he gets
steadily better as his hair gets whiter, by the
middle of next century he will have worked it
up to something over sixty. He’ll still be going
in first wicket down and coming out last but one.
He won’t go in first, a place for which Nature
certainly designed him, as he abhors ostentation
of any kind. That is why he so carefully refrains
from making strokes that are at all likely to appeal
to the eye of the multitude. There, he’s
popped one under his leg for another two.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it perfectly atrocious?” said Miss Grace
indignantly. “Why <i>does</i> he do it?”</p>

<p>“To bring his score up to thirty-five,” said the
Optimist, “without the crowd suspecting that he’s
got so many. If they were to applaud him, they’d
put him off his game.”</p>

<p>“I wish they would, then,” said Miss Grace
cruelly. “Why don’t somebody bowl him? the
little horror! There, did you see him snick that one
away for another single? That makes him thirty-six.
It’s positively wicked of him. I wonder how
a silly point would affect him?”</p>

<p>“Every low dodge of that kind has been tried
and found wanting years ago,” said the Optimist.</p>

<p>Miss Grace grew pensive for a moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>“I have it!” she cried. “I’ll tell Charlie, if he’s
still in at lunch, to go on again at the top end, and
pitch short and bump ’em. If Charlie hit him over
the heart about four times, that might give him
pause, don’t you think?”</p>

<p>“I doubt it,” said I; “unless Charlie happens to
be a Maxim gun.”</p>

<p>As the players came trooping in from the
field, pangs of sadness overtook both the Optimist
and me, for we knew that for the present our right
good time was at an end. We were condemned to
go and lunch in the stuffy marquee, among the
wasps and bad speeches. But I had failed to allow
for the particular talent of the Optimist. He is a
man who is certain to make his mark in diplomacy
one day. His eye had observed a pretty substantial
hamper on the roof of the coach.</p>

<p>“Pity us, Grace,” said he appealingly, as we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
prepared to descend. “We’ve got to spend the
next hour in that ‘Inferno,’ fishing flies out of the
salad and ‘hearing, hearing’ the Earl’s annual,
‘Gentlemen, I can assure you that this auspicious
occasion is one of the proudest moments of my—er—er—life.’
Pity us, Grace!”</p>

<p>“I do, old chap,” said Grace, very earnestly.
“But you needn’t, you know. That is, if you can
stand sandwiches and ginger beer. There’s lots
here, in the hamper. Oh! and I think there’s a
bottle of fizz.”</p>

<p>“It’s really too good of you,” said the Optimist.
But Miss Grace was so prompt in her attempt to
pull forth the hamper in question from under the
seat that our thanks, scruples, and retreat were all
alike submerged in the assistance we felt bound to
lend her.</p>

<p>“What a weight it is!” said I. “There must be
enough for both teams here.”</p>

<p>“I believe in being prepared for emergencies,”
said she. “Feed ’em, I say. A man that can’t
eat’s no good for cricket. And there’s certain to be
some of the boys along presently. Hullo! here’s
Charlie, for one. Don’t he look awfully sorry for
himself, poor old chap! That’s ’cause he’s got no
wickets. Buck up, Charlie!”</p>

<p>The best bowler in England climbed up on to
the roof.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>“Now then, Grace,” said he briskly. “Keep ’em
from that fizz. Two of your beef-slabs round, mind,
before that’s touched. That’s for dessert. Brightside,
I should recommend you to stick to Caley.
I’m certain to bowl you neck and heels if you
don’t.”</p>

<p>“Same as you’ve been serving ’em this morning,”
said Miss Grace.</p>

<p>“Don’t be rude, Grace,” said he. “But give me
a sandwich. Oh, I say, and do you see which fizz
you’ve brought? Whew! won’t there be a row!
You know that the Guv’nor particularly said it
was not to be touched.”</p>

<p>“Well, Charlie, now,” said his sister, “do you
think I’d bring that sugary stuff to give to pretty
nearly a county team?—one of ’em going out with
Stoddy, too. But the Guv.’s an awful good sort,
and I’m sure he’ll see it in a proper light when I
explain to him that I couldn’t possibly give that
horrid what-do-you-call-it to a team like we’ve got
to-day. Besides, he’d only have let the Bishop and
the Rural Dean have had it. I’ll take good care
they don’t get it, though. Let ’em stick to their
port. Never saw such a pair of old muffs in my
life. ’Don’t know a bat from a bagpipe!” Then,
as she distributed a napkinful of the solidest beef
sandwiches I ever saw, she continued with manifest
perplexity: “Do you know that I can never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
understand on what principle they go on in the
Church to get their preferment. There’s Toddles,
now. Look at Toddles. ’Got his Blue, plays
for Kent and the Gentlemen, and his cutting’s
simply marvellous, and yet he’s just a common
curate. And then there’s my old Guv’nor. ’Don’t
want to boast, but my old Guv’nor’s—— Well,
look what Lillywhite says about him. He’d play
the whole Dean and Chapter left hand with a
toothpick, and yet <i>he</i> don’t wear gaiters. ’Can’t
reckon it up at all. Don’t it seem ridiculous?
’specially when you come to think of the set of old
duffers who do.”</p>

<p>“Grace, don’t be libellous,” said the best bowler
in England, with a face of keen enjoyment. “Drop
your jaw and look sharp with those glasses.”</p>

<p>“May I participate in this pleasant function?”
said a meek voice. The little parson clambered on
to the roof and smiled into our midst.</p>

<p>“Toddles!” cried Miss Grace, with a flashing
eye. “How dare you! Don’t you show your face
here, you—you—you little curate! Aren’t you
thoroughly ashamed?”</p>

<p>“My dear Grace, I have no words in which to
express my penitence,” said the little parson, in a
broken tone; but as he looked at us his face had
such a twinkle in it that I’m sure he must have
been a master of deceit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>“Oh, you haven’t!” said Miss Grace scornfully.
“Well, Toddles, it’s lucky for you that you made
that score against Notts yesterday. One can’t say
exactly what’s in one’s mind to a man who’s
just made a score like that. Say you’re sorry,
Toddles, and I’ll forgive you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Grace! how magnanimous you are!” cried
the little parson, in throbbing accents. “I can
assure you that time only will assuage my sorrow!”</p>

<p>“If time don’t, stone-ginger will, and that’s a
cert.,” said the irreverent Charlie. “Try one, old
man”; and the best bowler in England poured
out a Caley for the erring one.</p>

<p>The little parson tossed it off, and fell upon a
massive sandwich with a vigour that was in disproportion
to his inches.</p>

<p>It was one of the liveliest cricket lunches at
which I ever assisted; and I think the heartiest.
Miss Grace’s sandwiches had certainly been designed
for very punishing batsmen and terrific fast
bowlers. Two great slices of bread with a succulent
chunk of beef between went to the making of
them. He who ate one had partaken of no inconsiderable
meal; he who ate two must have had
an appetite of which any man ought to have been
proud. But Miss Grace herself set us all a noble
example. She fell on one of these tremendous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
slabs with the courage of a lion, and had a big
stone-ginger all to herself.</p>

<p>“Charlie,” said the little parson, “we’d better
put Grace on at the top end after lunch. She
seems in great form.”</p>

<p>“’Wish you would,” said Grace wistfully. “I’d
shift ’em. ’Just feel like it. Pass the mustard,
Mr. Dimsdale. Thanks aw’fly. Cheery, help yourself.
’Won’t wait to be invited, will you? You’ll
find some apples underneath. Now then, Toddles,
buck up! You’re not in church. Ham or beef?
’Nother beer for Charlie.”</p>

<p>“If we’d only got some gin, it would improve
it,” sighed England’s best bowler.</p>

<p>“Mr. Dimsdale, if you’ll look in the left-hand
corner, right down at the bottom,” said Miss Grace,
“you’ll find a bottle. Charlie, how dare you!
Don’t you touch that fizz. Mr. Dimsdale, I repose
<i>implicit</i> confidence in you.”</p>

<p>“Grace,” said the best bowler in England, brandishing
the gin bottle, “you’re a trump!”</p>

<p>“Always was,” said Miss Grace. “But it’s not
until Middlesex and Kent get beastly, jolly hungry
that they think it worth their while to talk about it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’ve got your points,” said her brother.
“You do know how to feed us. ’Seem to know
exactly what we like. Your feeding’s lovely.
Look at these sandwiches; they’re a dream.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>“Two of ’em ’d be a nightmare,” said the little
parson.</p>

<p>“For a man your size, perhaps,” Miss Grace
said. “Ought to have brought a few of those
anchovy things for you. And, Toddles, I forbid
you to have gin. Sure to get into your head, you
know, and then you’d miss another catch.”</p>

<p>“Here, no-ball! That’s a chuck!” cried Charlie.
“I’ll have Jim Phillips to you, Grace. You don’t
give the poor chap a chance.”</p>

<p>“Charlie, if you’re rude you’ll get no fizz.”</p>

<p>Miss Grace foraged in the hamper and produced
two bottles of that giddy liquid. She promptly
began to unwire them, too. Disdaining our
earnest and repeated offers to withdraw the corks,
she pulled them out herself with considerable ease
and neatness, saying,—</p>

<p>“’Daren’t trust you men with this. I’ll measure
it myself, then all of us will get a share. Hands
down, Charlie. Oh, yes, I know being a bowler’s
beastly thirsty; thank you so much for reminding
me. Look alive, Mr. Dimsdale, with those glasses.
You’ll find ’em wrapped up in the <i>Sporting Life</i>.”</p>

<p>“She means <i>The Woman at Home</i>, in Annie S.
Swan’s grand new serial,” said the little parson,
with something that bore a perilous resemblance to
a common wink.</p>

<p>“Go on, pile it up!” The voice of Miss Grace<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
was more indignant than the hissing of the fizz.
“And, Toddles, I saw you. Oh, you naughty little
curate. You’d better be careful, Toddles, or I
won’t work that sweater for you. Pass that to
Cheery. Don’t drink it yet. I’ve got to propose
a toast.”</p>

<p>When we were all furnished with a means to
honour it, our hostess insisted on our standing up
along with her, whereon she held the glass aloft,
and cried in a voice pregnant with emotion:</p>

<p>“Here’s luck to good old Stoddy in the
autumn!”</p>

<p>We pledged him with great fervour.</p>

<p>“I say, you men,” said Grace. “That went well,
didn’t it? And I say, isn’t this stuff just prime.
My old guv’nor knows a thing or two. And what
price the Bishop and the Rural Dean? It’s positive
extravagance in my old guv’nor to lavish it on those
old jossers. But they look like being left, eh?
Next time they’ll get the other sort, and that’ll
sour their ‘outlook,’ and their preaching won’t be
quite so full of hope. But we’d better finish it now
it’s here. Fill up, and we’ll drink another.”</p>

<p>The second was: “Here’s luck to good old
Archie of that ilk!”</p>

<p>This was drunk with acclamation. And the
champagne still continuing to hold out, nothing
would satisfy the enthusiasm of Miss Grace but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
that a third should be proposed. It was evidently
pretty near her heart, for her colour rose, her eyes
sparkled, and her lips began to tremble.</p>

<p>“Here’s to dear old Charlie, and may Stoddy
have the sense to take him too. And it’s a great
big shame he’s not been yet invited!”</p>

<p>Charlie having been pushed down into an
attitude of repose by main force, we drank this
more heartily than ever. And the feeling provoked
by the peculiar circumstances of the case was so
extreme, that when the gallant little parson broke
out into a rousing cheer that did an infinite amount
of credit to so small a man, the rest of us supported
him in such a stentorian fashion that we attracted
the attention of the general public.</p>

<p>“Stow that rot!” exclaimed the best bowler in
England, whose discomposure was rather painful.
“Confound you, Grace, what have you got to play
the giddy goat like this for!”</p>

<p>“Speech! speech!” cried Miss Grace, hugely
delighted at the condition to which she had reduced
him. The great bowler grew more embarrassed
than ever.</p>

<p>“Now then, Charlie, buck up,” said his sister.
“Don’t keep us waiting. We can’t get on with
the serious business, the sandwiches and so forth,
until you’ve acknowledged the honour that we’ve
done you. Now then, let’s see you do the thing in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
style. Like you used to do it at the Union, you
know. What price, old Charlie, at the Union?”</p>

<p>“Oh, this is all beastly bally rot,” exclaimed the
great bowler most miserably red. “Dimsdale, if
you don’t stop grinning, you’ll be sorry. Grace, I’ll
get level with <i>you</i>, take <i>my</i> word. I’ll drop every
bally catch that comes, and talk about misfielding
and the overthrows—I’ll give <i>you</i> beans!”</p>

<p>Miss Grace, in her capacity as president of the
feast, hammered the hamper top with an empty
stone-ginger beer bottle in a very resolute manner,
and said:</p>

<p>“Now then, Charlie, are you going to buck up and
begin? Something in the Earl’s style, don’t you
know. ‘Unaccustomed as I am to public speaking’
sort of thing. You know, something with a bit
of class about it, and not so much of your awfully
beastly bally. Not good form at all you know,
Charlie. Quite third rate, don’t you know. Now
then, I’ve given you a friendly lead. Let’s see you
stand up like a man, and say, ‘Mr. Chairman and
Gentlemen, unaccustomed as I am——’ Well,
why don’t you go on?”</p>

<p>“Just you shut your face, Grace, and pass me
a ham sandwich, and let’s have the mustard
this way. You’d better drop your rotting, Grace,
it really isn’t funny,” said the poor bowler
wriggling dismally.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>“<i>You’re</i> pretty humorous though,” said his sister
cruelly. “If you’ll be good enough to look as
funny as that till I find my kodak. I’ll take a snapshot
of you. You would send up the circulation
of the <i>Windsor Magazine</i>. ‘Eminent cricketer replying
to the toast of his health.’ What, ho!”</p>

<p>If a wasp had not settled itself on the dazzling
white collar of poor Charlie’s persecutor and demanded
extremely discreet conduct on the part of
Miss Grace whilst three men gallantly but cautiously
arranged its capture and decease, it is possible that
the great bowler’s bad time would have continued
longer than it did. Miss Grace Trentham, having
rather severely handled a famous exponent of the
game, turned her attention to one of even greater
eminence. Stoddart’s blindness in omitting to ask
Charlie to make the trip to Australia was trenchantly
reviewed.</p>

<p>“If Stoddy don’t take Charlie,” Miss Grace said
with weighty deliberation, “Stoddy’ll be wrong.
Charlie’s worth three Jack Hearnes this season,
and Mold and Richardson aren’t in it. ’Fact it’s
my ’pinion that if Charlie had only got a bit more
intellect, and hadn’t such a gift for drinking
things, he’d be another Spoff.”</p>

<p>“Go on, Grace, keep at it,” murmured the gentleman
in question with a most pathetic air of resignation.
“That’s the fizz. Girls and champagne as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
usual. To watch the fluent way they lip it, you’d
think it was only milk. But it gets there just the
same. Go on, Grace; let’s hear what else it’s got
to say.”</p>

<p>“Charlie, you’re a coarse person,” said his sister.
“You had better take your hat off to let the sun
expurgate your ideas a bit.”</p>

<p>“Grace,” said the little parson, “you’re a regular
Jessop when it comes to hitting. That’s six.”</p>

<p>“Do you believe in dreams, Mr. Dimsdale?” said
Miss Grace suddenly.</p>

<p>“Well, I was born in the West country, so I
suppose I’m obliged to,” said I.</p>

<p>“Well, I dreamt last night but one,” said she,
“that a wire came from town to Charlie, saying,
‘Will you complete team? Name inadvertently
omitted. Stoddart.’”</p>

<p>A roar of laughter considerably interfered with
Miss Grace’s narrative.</p>

<p>“Grace, if you keep playing this game,” said
the best bowler in England, fighting for his
breath, “I shall die young. Name inadvertently
omitted’s rather good.”</p>

<p>“Certain it has been,” said Miss Grace with deep
conviction. “Stoddy would never be such a blind
owl as to leave you out on purpose, Charlie. I’ve
a very high opinion of Stoddy.”</p>

<p>“Stoddy will be pleased,” piped the little parson.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>“If that’s meant for sarcasm, Toddles,” said Miss
Grace, “you’d better save it for your fielding. It
needs it more than I do.”</p>

<p>“Put her down another six,” said Charlie.
“She’s serving all the bowling alike. She is in a
punishing mood. Toddles, if you’ll take my tip,
you’ll go off next over.”</p>

<p>“Don’t take much to flog the stuff <i>you’ve</i> been
rolling up this morning, anyhow,” said Miss Grace
truculently. “But I’ve been on the point of writing
to Stoddy once or twice to tell him that he’s forgotten
to invite you, Charlie.”</p>

<p>“Good God, what the, the——!” spluttered the
horrified Charlie very incoherently indeed. The
bare possibility of such an unheard of proceeding
half paralysed the poor bowler. His clerical friend,
who had acquired in some mysterious manner
a laugh that began in his boots and rose in
Rabelaisian moments as high as his knee-joints,
nearly tumbled off the coach in wrestling with it.</p>

<p>“I would do it if I thought I would,” said Miss
Grace stoutly, and the half-perplexed solemnity of
her countenance made three of us howl with joy;
the fourth, however, looked as though he would
never smile again.</p>

<p>“You needn’t tell us that, we know it,” moaned
the poor bowler. “That’s why you’re such a
source of comfort to us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>“Toddles,” said Miss Grace, addressing herself
to the Rev. Mr. Elphinstone, who was engaged in
shinning the Optimist on the off-chance that the
Optimist’s mind might be invaded by some much-needed
solemnity, “Toddles, your behaviour is
positively low. But Charlie, now, don’t you think,
as Stoddy must have overlooked you, it would be
doing the right thing by him to write and tell him
so before it is too late? No good for him to know it,
would it, when Sid Gregory and Clem Hill and
that lot are knocking the cover off the ball as they
did before?”</p>

<p>“Go on, go on,” said the great bowler; “it sounds
like sacred music.”</p>

<p>“Well, anyhow,” she continued, “I’m not going
to let England lose the rubber this time, if I can
help it. And they will, that’s a cert., if you’re
not there, Charlie, to rattle their timber. They
can play everybody else as easily as they’d play
that stuff o’ Toddles’s.”</p>

<p>“Cheek,” said the reverend patentee of “that stuff
o’ Toddles’s,” employing the power of speech with
evident difficulty, “awful cheek.”</p>

<p>“Always was you know, Toddles, your bowling,”
said Miss Grace indulgently. “But we won’t go
into that now. What ought I to say to Stoddy
when I write him? Would he think it too familiar if
I began, ‘My dear Mr. Stoddart,’ or ought it to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
‘Dear Sir’? Don’t quite know how to start it,
don’t you know. You see Stoddy’s not exactly an
ordinary person, don’t you see. The Guv’nor says
great men are so touchy.”</p>

<p>Miss Grace was evidently embarrassed. So
were some others. The little parson’s laughter
rumbled from his boots until one wondered how his
small eights could hold so much. As for the unhappy
Charlie, he was so completely demoralised
that after saying, “Why don’t some of you men
give her another stone-ginger to keep her quiet?”
he proceeded to fill an immense tumbler with neat
gin for that purpose, under the impression that he
was pouring out ginger beer.</p>

<p>When at last things had sorted themselves out a
bit, during which process Miss Grace, the innocent
cause of this disorder, regarded us all with unaffected
gravity, the little parson said, with an
expression of really concentrated elfishness: “But
you know, you men, there’s a wonderful amount
of truth in what Grace says. If Stoddy really has
forgotten Charlie, and if she reminds him of the
fact, she will be doing a service to her country,
won’t she?”</p>

<p>“By Jove, she will,” chorused the Optimist and I.</p>

<p>“Well, if that’s the case, I’m sure I’ll write to
Stoddy then,” said Grace.</p>

<p>And she looked as though she meant to do it too.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>The poor bowler had got about as much as he
could bear. I think I never saw a grown man look
more completely overborne. He began doggedly to
munch another sandwich, and nearly choked himself
by trying to whistle a jaunty music hall ditty
expressive of heart-easing mirth with his mouth
full. When he spoke, his voice was so subdued
and melancholious that, as Miss Grace said, it reminded
her of Toddles reading the marriage
service.</p>

<p>“She’ll do it,” he said. “Rather a good joke for
me, eh? He’s sure to show it to McGregor and
O’Brien and that lot. They’ll simply die. Shan’t
be able to show my face up at Lord’s for years.
Awfully nice for me, eh?”</p>

<p>“Well,” Miss Grace said, “I hope Stoddy does
show it to McGregor and O’Brien and that lot.
They’ll tell him what a fool he’s been to overlook
you, Charlie.”</p>

<p>“She means it,” said I, to console him.</p>

<p>“I should rather think she does,” said he. “If
she once gets a giddy idea into that gaudy feminine
head of hers, there’s nothing can shift it. She’s a
downright terror. And, I should like to know
what cove it was that said women had no sense o’
humour. Why they’re that darned funny they
ought to be put in a circus.”</p>

<p>“Awful good sort Grace is though, when you get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
to know her,” said the little parson, most caressingly,
“and no end of a patriot as well. She sinks all
private and domestic matters when the welfare of
her country is concerned. Shouldn’t be a bit surprised
if, when this leaks out, they don’t get up a
shilling testimonial to her in the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>.”</p>

<p>“’Nother beer for Toddles,” said the recipient of
this flattery, “and Toddles, you can have some gin
in it, if you like.”</p>

<p>Mercifully enough for her luckless brother
Charlie, Miss Grace here remembered that she was
hostess, and suspended the conversation to a more
convenient season while she ministered to our
wants. We all fell again in earnest to our interrupted
meal; but I’m sure that the best bowler in
England was so depressed throughout his entire
being, that he couldn’t possibly have enjoyed his.</p>

<p>There was a delicious sense of out-of-doors and
the open air as we sat up here under the genial sun
of summer. The band was playing now, and the
smart mob from the various carriages and the
ladies’ tent was parading the bright green lawn
prior to the resumption of the game. The crowd
was beginning to re-assemble round the ring. And
here and there we could observe from our exalted
situation, various of the players making a tour of
the ground, in their “blancoed” boots and brilliant
blazers, pretty generally accompanied too by graceful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
persons in straw hats and white piqué. Some of
these graceful persons happened to be “dressed,”
it is true, but their costumes bid the pen pause, as
nothing less than a fashion journal could describe
them.</p>

<p>“I think girls look jolly nice and cool all in
white,” said Charlie. “None of your brown
holland for me, thank you. Aren’t fond o’ that
ruffly, crumply sort o’ stuff, are you Toddles?”</p>

<p>“No,” said the cruel Toddles. “And to my unsophisticated
mind plain ribands look more chaste
than those staring Zingari ties and things they crib
from their male relations.”</p>

<p>But Miss Grace was far too occupied in attacking
her mighty second sandwich, and insisting on her
guests adventuring a third, holding that great
virtues were resident therein, to heed this brilliant
persiflage. Besides, the injustice was too palpable.
For I’m certain that had Grace chosen to wear a
potato sack, with a ribbon of the Zingari black, red
and yellow round the neck of it, she would have
made an effect all poetry and sunshine and been
a positive delight. The brown holland was quite
plain and simple, without one suspicion of a flounce;
but its wearer had invested it with all the glamours
of a love scene out of Meredith. Hers was a
natural genius of beauty for which she was not all
responsible. Without the slightest art or consideration,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
it looked out of her eyes. She must
have known all about it, being a girl. Nevertheless
she was not in the least uplifted by it, and
would have much preferred to play for Middlesex
than to be the belle of a London season.</p>

<p>When at last the formal luncheon was at an end,
and the Earl’s speech had been duly delivered for
the benefit of the <i>Little Clumpton Advertiser</i>, two
persons of light and leading were observed to be bearing
down upon our drag. One was the honourable
and reverend parent of Miss Grace; the other was
the Earl himself. It was good to notice the celerity
with which our hostess slipped the empty champagne
bottles, bearing their tell-tale labels, back
into the hamper at the first approach of these
dignitaries.</p>

<p>“Mum’s the word, you know,” said she, “if the
Guv wants to know what we’ve had to drink.
His natural benevolence sometimes leads him to
ask lots o’ questions that he oughtn’t to.”</p>

<p>As soon as the new comers halted immediately
beneath us, Miss Grace greeted them in the hearty
fashion that was her wont.</p>

<p>“Hullo, father! had a good lunch? Hullo,
Dicky! Got your speech off all comfy, or did
you break down in the middle, as you usually
do?”</p>

<p>“A bit nearer the end this time,” said the Earl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>“Anyhow,” said Miss Grace, “I hope you didn’t
shove in your usual reference to Alfred Mynn and
Fuller Pilch and that crowd. I think everybody’s
getting about sick of ’em. What with the Old
Man and Ranji and Andrew Lang, they’re getting
stale. You take my advice, Dicky, and give ’em
a rest. Everybody’ll be so grateful, and as it’ll
make your peroration shorter by about ten minutes,
you can bet that their gratitude will be pretty
genuine.”</p>

<p>“Clean out of the ground again,” cried England’s
best bowler in great delight. “’Nother six.
She keeps on lifting ’em. Charlie Thornton isn’t
in it. Dick, you take my advice, and clear out
o’ this while you’re well.”</p>

<p>“What have I done to deserve this?” said the
poor Earl appealingly.</p>

<p>“’Feel like it,” said Miss Grace. “And so would
you, Dicky, had you been sitting up here all the
jolly morning putting down Little Clumpton’s
runs, watching Halliday batting like an angel,
and Toddles dropping him, and ordinary club men
smacking Charlie’s best for fours. 165 for one;
isn’t it disgraceful? However, you had better come
up here, Dicky, and I’ll give you an apple to keep
you good.”</p>

<p>“Can’t, much as I regret it,” said the Earl.
“’Got my social duties to attend to.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>“A useful yarn,” said Miss Grace.</p>

<p>“And, Laura,” said the deep voice of Miss
Grace’s parent, “I should like you to come down
and attend to yours. There’s all the county here,
and you’ve not even acknowledged them yet.”</p>

<p>“’Haven’t seen one of ’em except in the distance,”
said his ingenuous daughter.</p>

<p>“You are scarcely likely to, if you carefully keep
out of their way,” said the Rector.</p>

<p>“Seems to be a lot o’ truth in that,” said Miss
Grace, wagging her head very thoughtfully.
“Funny I didn’t think of that before. But I tell
you what, pater: if they ask you where I am, tell
’em I’ve got an old frock on, and that I’m afraid
to face the music. It’ll please ’em awfully, and
it won’t hurt me. See!”</p>

<p>By the anxious expression on the old gentleman’s
face it was evident that this proposal was
not altogether in accordance with his ideas. He
was deeply desirous of bringing his daughter round
to his own point of view, yet didn’t know how.
It was clearly a case for a mamma to exercise her
prerogative, as a mere father is not made of stern
enough stuff to thwart a daughter in the enjoyment
of her own way. Miss Grace, however, was by
no means insensible to her parent’s deeply solicitous
look.</p>

<p>“All right, father, I’ll come,” she said. Then,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
turning round to us, added in an apologetic undertone,
“My old guv’nor’s such an awful good sort,
don’t you see, that when he looks like that, I can’t
resist him. But I sha’n’t stop long. Can’t stand
a set o’ women inquiring whether I take any
interest in cricket, and can I tell ’em what a
maiden is, and what are those funny things that
some o’ the men have got strapped on their legs?
I shall cut early. And oh! I say, Cheery, will you
do the scoring while I’m gone? ’Know how to
take the analysis, don’t you? In red ink, mind.
Here you are. Oh! and if you observe any of those
public school cubs prowling round, don’t let ’em
come up. Keep ’em down with your boot. Bye,
bye; back soon!”</p>

<p>Miss Grace then departed to do the right thing
by her friends, just as the bell rang for the clearance
of the ground. And as she walked, with the
Earl on one side of her and her parent on the
other, she looked not unlike a deserter being reluctantly
led back in custody to her regiment.</p>

Record Breaking</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“POOR old Grace!” said the little parson.
“Quite a martyr to public duty, isn’t she?
I didn’t think she’d go.”</p>

<p>“And she wouldn’t, that’s a moral,” said her
brother, “had it been anybody but the Guv. Her
consideration for the Guv is something beautiful.
’Wish she’d extend it to some other members of her
family.”</p>

<p>“There’s none of ’em can grumble,” said the
little parson warmly. “She’s a mother to the lot.
’Gives you milk gruel when you’re sick. ’Won’t
have you stay out late. ’Sends you in strict training
before the Gentlemen and Players. ’Always
up at Lords to give you the privilege of her advice.
’Coaches the lot of you like a pro. ’Dots
your I’s and crosses your T’s for you, and puts
your eyes and limbs together generally. Surely
it isn’t reasonable to expect more from a sister;
but some men want so thundering much. Tell you
what, my boy, if there’d been no Grace to restrict<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
your spiritual needs and minister to your temporal,
Cambridge hadn’t cut up Oxford as they did, and
Middlesex hadn’t been champion county. Grace
is a trump!”</p>

<p>The little parson’s heat was such that he was
compelled to wipe his forehead.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t deny that Grace has her points,”
said that young person’s brother.</p>

<p>“And no end of a fine girl is Grace,” said the
little parson, quite at the mercy of his theme.
“Real A 1, and looks it. And there’s nobody to
deny it either.”</p>

<p>“’Never could see it myself,” drawled Charlie,
who in his fraternal capacity was of course at no
pains to conceal his boredom. “’Can’t see where
her looks come in at all.”</p>

<p>“If she were some other fellow’s sister, it’s likely
that you might,” said I.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was that my tone conveyed more
than I was aware of, for the great bowler looked
at me with a shrewdly humorous countenance
that rather reminded me of Robert Abel’s.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Toddles!” he observed. “What price
that? ’Nother victim. I’m getting to recognise
the symptoms straight away. But, Dimsdale,
you be advised. The Rectory positively reeks of
slaughtered innocence. Two refused last week.
Now, don’t you come and play the goat.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>“Wonder who it will be in the end?” asked
the poor dear Optimist to cover my retreat. But
his own effort was a perfect masterpiece of self-repression.</p>

<p>“Perhaps the noble Earl,” said the little parson.
“He’s been right over his ears this two years.
Poor old Dick!”</p>

<p>“No blooming fear!” said Miss Grace’s brother,
with a profound conviction that both delighted and
depressed the poor old Optimist and the miserable me.
“Dick’s a rank outsider. ’Hasn’t a thousand-to-one
chance. Last time he tried it on he sank so low
as to tell her what his income was. ‘Now, look
here, Dick,’ said she, ‘I don’t care a straw about
your income; what’s your batting average?’
Fact! Told it to the ’Varsity, and they put it in
<i>The Granta</i>. And the joke is, that Dick is the
most horrible muff you ever saw. ’Couldn’t get
a run to save his life. Well, he sent for Attewell
and Brockwell to coach him all the spring. But
he’s not yet at the top of the first-class averages.”</p>

<p>“Well, <i>who</i> will it be?” I asked recklessly.</p>

<p>“Ask another,” said Charlie, “for I’m hanged
if I know. Ranji in his best year might have had
a look in, and I think she’d take the Old Man even
now. Jacker, and Stoddy, and Archie McLaren,
and that crush, all just miss it.”</p>

<p>“All just miss it?” I said weakly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>“All just miss it,” said Charlie magisterially.
“If Sammy Woods’s heart had stood the strain,
his bowling might have put him in the running,
because she says that, whereas batsmen are a
common growth, bowlers come from heaven.”</p>

<p>As the best bowler in England quoted this
opinion, the twinkle in his eye was marvellous.</p>

<p>“But Jack Mason and Charlie Fry have been
going pretty strong of late,” said the little parson.</p>

<p>“They’ll have to be regular Sandows before
they’ll fill her eye,” said Grace’s brother, “she’s
that mighty hypercritical. At least, that’s what
a literary Johnny called her. He kept rolling
Greek up to her, and comparing her to Nausicaa.
She asked him whether Nausicaa was a batsman
or a bowler, as she knew for a fact that his name
was not in Wisden. But when the silly owl began
to simplify himself, he wished he hadn’t spoke.
She knocked three fours and two sixes off him—all
in one over. By crum! didn’t she make hay! As
for Jack Mason, he’s got a blind sort o’ shove
behind point off a rising ball that she don’t approve
of, whilst Charlie Fry’s bowling action is so darned
ugly that I don’t much fancy <i>him</i>.”</p>

<p>“Second bell,” said the little parson. “We’d
better cut.”</p>

<p>“Yes, curse it,” said the great bowler with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
groan. “’Got to be rolling ’em up all the afternoon
at ninety in the shade. Wicket concrete, and two
men going as they please. Bowlers <i>have</i> to come
from heaven, I say, or they’d simply kick. ’Wants
a blooming archangel to be a bowler. Poor devils!
What <i>are</i> the sins of their fathers that some men
should be born bowlers?”</p>

<p>“Evolution teaches us,” said the little parson
with resonant solemnity, “that when a man’s forbears
have been for generations in the habit of
fielding really bad, dropping catches, slow pick-up,
stopping ’em with their boot, wild returns, fumbling,
failing to back up, real downright infernal blood-coloured
idleness, and so forth—that poor bloke
is likely to be born a bowler. Nature will avenge
itself, you know.”</p>

<p>“’Must have been several Keys and Martin
Hawkes in our family, then, at one time or
another,” said Charlie. Here however a ray of
hope came to him. “Of course,” said he, “your
men’ll declare when they get about three hundred.”</p>

<p>“Well, what would you do,” said I, “if you’d
not got a ha’porth o’ bowling, against a batting side
like Hickory’s?”</p>

<p>“Cert’nly declare,” said the bowler with wonderful
conviction. “Great folly if you don’t. Always
the unexpected that happens at cricket,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
don’t you know. ’Might absolutely scuttle us as
our men’ll be tired as the Ten blooming Tribes, and
pretty well as sick.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said I, “I daresay we shall declare—at
half-past six.”</p>

<p>As the umpires were already out, there was
no time left in which the case might be considered
in all its aspects. It was a memorable sight when
Hickory took the field two minutes later. The
assembly was still greater than before. Little
Clumpton, always warm favourites, since they relied
on purely local men, had had the might of their
achievement noised abroad. 165 for one wicket
against Hickory’s formidable side was a morning’s
work that had sent the majority of those present
into the seventh heaven of enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Would Halliday get his hundred? Would Oldknow
get his fifty? The cheers that greeted these
heroes when they came out of the pavilion was
something to cherish in the memory. They
marched to the crease with stately unconcern.
Their apparent unconsciousness of the clamour
they had excited bordered on the sublime.</p>

<p>They began with extreme caution. The first few
overs were a repetition of their morning’s methods.
There was no hurry for runs. The Ancient cocked
one under his leg for two, and the Captain stole a
single. This was the sum total of their scoring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
during the first ten minutes. Was Halliday never
going to get his hundred? He still required one.
The fielding was so keen and the bowling so
straight that there still seemed an element of
uncertainty about it. This assumed a palpable
shape a moment later, when every man in the
slips, point, the bowler, the wicket-keeper, and
heaven knows who besides, yelled at the pitch of
their lungs.</p>

<p>“How’s that?”</p>

<p>One could almost hear the great heart of the
crowd beating through the terribly portentous
silence, that so respectfully awaited the umpire’s
verdict. The Optimist and I bent forward in our
eagerness. Could it be that Halliday was to have
the cup dashed from his lips in this manner? We
despondently remembered that it was nine years
since a man had scored a century for Little
Clumpton <i>v.</i> Hickory. Suddenly the wicket-keeper
threw down the ball with an impatient gesture.
The crisis was passed. Halliday was given in.
He cut Charlie’s next ball like a knife to the
boundary. The scene that ensued is not to be
described. Veterans cheered; strong men adjourned
for beer. The best bowler in England to be collared
to this tune! Little Clumpton 192 for 1. Halliday,
not out, 103. And that this moment might be
furnished with every joy on which the great British<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
Public dotes, a small boy in the exuberance of
the hour, thought well to fall from a tall tree
wherein he was perched, and delighted the populace
by showing it how easily he could break his
collar-bone.</p>

<p>By cocking T. S. M. under his leg for another
two, the Ancient completed his fifty in the following
over. Runs were beginning to come as they
pleased. Each batsman had satisfied his dreams.
He could now afford to take liberties and play to
the crowd a bit. The Captain did; the Ancient
didn’t. It sums up the essential difference between
the two. The Captain began to talk to T. S. M.
He leapt out and hit him out of the ground for six.
T. S. M. immediately went off, obedient, doubtless,
to a peremptory command that appeared to proceed
from the recesses of the ladies’ tent.</p>

<p>H. C., the lion-hearted, still continued to hurl
them down at his best pace. But it was manifestly
not his day. The Captain, with his score at 112,
was palpably missed at the wicket. Charlie also
beat the Ancient twice with successive balls, and
occasionally knocked at that little batsman’s ribs,
no doubt to remind him that he was becoming a
nuisance. The Ancient, however, merely drew
a long breath to assure himself that it was not a
compound fracture, blinked reflectively, took a
new guard, and continued as before. Two hundred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
went up, and still no separation. Matters were
growing ominous. Men were heard to inquire
what was the record score in Little Clumpton <i>v.</i>
Hickory, by whom was it made, and when? It
appeared that Hickory’s 503 for nine, in the pre-declaration
days of 1887, held it. Would it be
eclipsed? Runs still came at their own sweet will.
With his score at 133, Halliday was missed off
Charlie for the second time by the unhappy wicket-keeper.
The crowd grew vigorous in its observations,
and began to applaud the poor beggar every
time he handled the ball. Whenever the British
Public swarm, they invariably bring their manners
with them.</p>

<p>The appearance of the “telegraph” was fast
becoming a thing of beauty. Ten followed ten
without the slightest hesitation. The bowling
began to exhibit signs of getting used up. Charlie,
still wicketless, had gone off, whilst that crowning
glory of a good side, its fielding, was not taking
itself quite so seriously as it did earlier in the day.
But neither the Optimist nor I were, perhaps, as
whole-hearted as we might have been in our enthusiasm.
Our thoughts would keep straying to Miss
Grace. Why had we not been born county cricketers?
It was bitterness for me to reflect that I was
already out for seven, and that my own impetuosity
had caused me to forfeit a chance for which so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
many sighed in vain. As for the Optimist, he was
conscious of certain rather pronounced weaknesses
in his style, which he was too old now to correct.</p>

<p>“Perhaps she hasn’t seen you bat, though?”
said I consolingly.</p>

<p>“She ain’t, that’s certain,” said he wearily;
“and if I’m lucky, she never will!”</p>

<p>Miss Grace was now returning. We saw the
assured figure of that young person, the perfection
of finely curved and elegant strength, emerge from
the interior of the ladies’ tent. Two <i>very</i> young
men stepped out after her. Miss Grace turned
round quickly, and although what she said was
brief, it was apparently to the point, as the pair
of them went back again without any delay
whatever.</p>

<p>As Miss Grace came along the confines of the
boundary to rejoin us, swinging her gloves as she
walked, an act of self-denial denoted that here was
no ordinary girl. The bowler was in the act of
delivering, and she was compelled to cross the
screen at his end. The ordinary girl would have
been quite unable to resist the fascination of passing
behind the bowler’s arm, and thereby delaying
the game until she had gone on her way rejoicing in
her crime. Miss Grace, however impossible it may
actually seem, waited while the bowler delivered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
the ball, and afterwards ran across the screen
as hard as she could in order to be well clear of
his arm by the time he was ready to send down
the next. The Optimist saw this also, and is prepared,
I understand, to affirm it on oath in the
presence of witnesses. And the pair of us will
no doubt one day persuade the authorities at Newnham
to recognise the pious character of her act by
erecting a stained glass window to her honourable
memory, even at the risk of causing that home
of the higher learning to build a chapel in which
to put it.</p>

<p>She was soon up beside us again, a pretty
healthy-looking anger seeming to emphasise her
charms.</p>

<p>“267 for one, Grace,” said the scorer; “Halliday
not out, 169. Oldknow, not out, 72. Oh, and
another four; that makes Halliday 173. 270 up,
boy.”</p>

<p>“Awfully obliged to you, old chap,” said Miss
Grace politely, as she took the score-book from the
Optimist. Her self-control really was remarkable,
but then women do claim to have more of it than
men.</p>

<p>“What sort of a time did they give you in
there?” asked the Optimist. He always had a
considerable temerity of his own. A thorough-going
optimist needs it, of course.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>“Pretty bad,” said Miss Grace, with a distinctly
blasé air. “One girl said that Charlie must have
an awful lot of enthusiasm, ’cause he kept running
about as hard as he could just for fun, while
everybody else was looking at him. Oh, some of
’em have a very pretty wit, I can tell you. But if
Hickory’s idea of humour is 271 for one, I wish
they’d try to be a bit serious sometimes, ’cause in
my idea that sort o’ fun’s not funny at all.”</p>

<p>“’Tis for us, I think,” said I.</p>

<p>“Very low form of amusement,” said Grace
judicially.</p>

<p>Here the game afforded us a new diversion.
The dauntless Halliday, whom good fortune had
now rendered absolutely reckless, lashed out for all
he was worth at a ball much too short to drive.
It went spinning up a dizzy height midway between
mid-off and cover-point, in which positions
the youthful T. S. M. and Carteret were fielding
respectively.</p>

<p>“At last!” sighed poor Miss Grace.</p>

<p>She was just a little bit premature, however.
Being between them, both men immediately started
for the catch; then each observing the other
coming, both stopped together and stood stock
still, each politely saying “Your ball!” at the
same moment, whilst the ball in question dropped
harmlessly to earth. The great British Public<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
rivalled Swift for pungency that minute. Poor
Miss Grace, however, grew positively white.</p>

<p>“I shall give ’em up,” she said.</p>

<p>There was soon a new matter to absorb the
attention of the speculative. Would Halliday make
200? It was a feat that had still to be accomplished
in Little Clumpton <i>v.</i> Hickory. But as
this is an age of record-breaking, it was quite
expected of our captain that he should do something
to maintain the traditions of his generation.
He rose to the occasion. Hitting out, without
favour and without fear, he soon set all doubts at
rest. A strong off-drive gave him his second
century.</p>

<p>“Have a cigarette, Miss Trentham,” said I,
passing her the case. She was not a young person
who gave one the impression of being greatly
troubled with “nerves”; but it was plain that
309 for one wicket had thrown the few she had
into a state of open mutiny.</p>

<p>“Don’t smoke,” Miss Grace said.</p>

<p>“Should rather have thought you would,” said
I mischievously.</p>

<p>“No,” said she with great sobriety; “it’s a bad
thing for condition. Besides, I’ve four brothers to
consider. And when they do get stale, I don’t like
’em to say it’s my fault. I always try to do the
straight thing by ’em, and set ’em a good example.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>“They invariably follow it, of course?”</p>

<p>“Well, no,” said Miss Grace reluctantly, “not
always. But you know,” she added quickly,
“they’re really pretty decent sorts when you get
to know their little ways. If you feed ’em well
and fetch their slippers for ’em, and you let ’em
have breakfast when they like, and you don’t
lecture ’em too much, you can get ’em to do
almost anything. And if Archie and Charlie have
got anything big on, they’re just as good as gold.
Hullo, Charlie’s going on again. Why don’t he
go on permanently?”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br>

The End of the Day</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">CHARLIE’S second ball was one of his best
breakbacks. The Captain in his carelessness
played a bit outside it. Back went his off stick.
At last the great partnership was dissolved. 312
for two, last man, 204. 301 had been added for
the wicket, which beat by 37 the record partnership
of Barclay and Perkins in 1882. Barclay’s
178 made on that occasion, the previous individual
best, was also superseded. As the hero ran
into the pavilion, the crowd simply rose at him.</p>

<p>The Pessimist succeeded. He was very correct,
watchful, and resourceful. Charlie smashed a
yorker at him to begin with, but the Pessimist
had heard of such things before. It takes more
than a common yorker to discompose a county
man. Presently the Ancient so far forgot himself
as to indulge in a drive for four.</p>

<p>“Has he got his fifty yet?” I asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>“He’s made 98, the little horror!” said Grace
indignantly. “I wonder if he ever will get out.”</p>

<p>“<i>He’s</i> all right,” said I. “He’s quite enjoying
it.”</p>

<p>A spell of very quiet play followed. Charlie’s
wicket provoked him to bowl five maidens in succession
to the Pessimist. But his sister was so
keen a critic that this proceeding mightily displeased
her.</p>

<p>“Fast bowlers,” said she, “are all big hearts and
brute force—no intellect at all you know. They’ve
got about as many brains as a giddy old crocodile.
What’s Charlie bowling like that for? Can’t he
see that he’s just helping that man to play himself
in? Why don’t he chuck him a ‘tice’ or a full
toss, or something that’s downright bad—anything
to make him have a go before he gets his eye
in.”</p>

<p>Ere long a thunderclap informed Hickory that
yet another century had been scored against them
that humiliating afternoon. The Ancient in defiance
of all criticism had had the audacity to complete
his hundred; and I for one believe most
firmly that Hickory never would have got him out
had not the Fates interfered on their behalf. For
as he attempted one of his favourite short ones
directly afterwards, A. H., fielding deep mid-off,
dashed in like a deer, gathered the ball, and hurled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
down the Ancient’s wicket with the energy of
despair, whilst that unfortunate was still cavorting
a yard outside the crease. Oldknow had played a
great innings, but——no, the Ancient is too sound
a bat and far too good a fellow for a Little Clumpton
man to say rude things about his play. Miss
Grace, a thorough-going Hickoryite, had no such
scruples.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t that a bit of lovely fielding,” said she,
drawing a deep breath. “I do like to see ’em field
like that; and it’s Oldknow, is it? Helped himself
to a hundred and one. I call that cheek. If he
could only bat I shouldn’t care.”</p>

<p>“Genius covers a multitude of sins,” said I.</p>

<p>“It’s got to, if he’s a genius,” said Miss Grace;
“but if that’s genius, give me something common.
Bad taste and all that, I know; but that chap
worries me. Besides, if he’s a genius, why don’t
he wear long hair and look intense, like Paderewski.
That might carry things off a bit, and
keep people from looking at his batting, don’t you
think?”</p>

<p>“By Jove,” said I, “very good idea. I’ll suggest
it to him.”</p>

<p>The Humourist, known as Merryweather in
private life, came out to the Pessimist. Cheers
greeted his appearance. The crowd knew him of
old. He was the most uncertain bat that ever put<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
on pads. Oh, but if he only stayed! One Gilbert
Jessop had to take second place if Merryweather
only stayed. True, he only did stay about five
times a season, but as no one knew the occasion
he was likely to honour with his presence for any
lengthened period, the apparition of his six feet
three of smiling insolence always sent a thrill
through the assembly.</p>

<p>“Bloomin’ ’ard and bloomin’ ’igh and bloomin’
often,” was his game. He was a man who carried
few theological ideas, but it was understood that
his conception of Paradise was a place of short
boundaries and unlimited lob-bowling. He had a
partiality for the Park, as it fulfilled the first of
these conditions.</p>

<p>“Isn’t this your Slogger?” asked Miss Grace.</p>

<p>“Now that slogging’s at a premium,” said
I, “we’d call him a fine, free, forcing batsman.”</p>

<p>“I wish these boundaries weren’t so jolly small,”
said Miss Grace with an apprehensive eye. “I
don’t like to see a man his inches come in smiling.”</p>

<p>The first ball the Humourist received he sent
humming over our coach into a cornfield at the
back. During the interval in which Hickory
endeavoured to recover it, the remarkable silence
of the Optimist attracted my attention. It was so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
foreign to his usual habit of kind discursiveness
that I felt there must be some grave reason for it.
He had not uttered a word for forty minutes.</p>

<p>“Brightside, when do you go in?” said I.</p>

<p>“Next but one,” he sighed.</p>

<p>This was a sufficient explanation. The man was
suffering. He was determined to be cheerful, but
could not disguise the pallor underneath his tan.
He drummed his fingers nervously on his knees; a
restlessness had taken him; there was a wild look
in his eye. Seizing a moment when Miss Grace
was occupied in evolving from the analysis the
number of runs Charlie had paid for his solitary
wicket the Optimist whispered,—</p>

<p>“Shouldn’t care a bit, you know, if she wasn’t
here. I was never properly coached at school, you
know. I will draw away from leg balls, you
know. If Charlie bowls any, you know, sure as
death, I shall retire towards the umpire. Do you
think she’ll be able to tell that from here?”</p>

<p>“They say Abel does the same,” said I evasively.</p>

<p>“And I’ve got no wrist, you know. Can’t cut
a bit, you know. Have to sort o’ shove ’em, you
know, with my arms and shoulders.”</p>

<p>“Quite a coincidence,” said I, “for they always
say that the Old Man does all his cutting with his
arms and shoulders.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>“And I’m always scraping forward and feeling
for ’em. Get so beastly flurried if I wait, that I’m
certain to be bowled.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said I, “it’s the sort of wicket on which
you can play forward to anything. Hard as concrete.”</p>

<p>“But she’s fair death on style,” said the poor old
Optimist. “She’s got such a terrible high standard,
don’t you know? Asked her this morning
what she thought of A. H.’s batting. ‘Well,’ she
said, ‘Archie’s a pretty fair <i>rustic</i> bat.’”</p>

<p>“She may take a much higher view of yours,”
said I. “Women are that funny, you don’t know
when you’ve got ’em. Shouldn’t be a bit surprised
if she don’t fall in with your style on the spot,
for really I’ve seen worse.”</p>

<p>“Not much,” groaned the poor old Optimist.</p>

<p>Here the voice of this unflinching critic, who
really had been born half a century too late,
such an ornament she would have been to <i>Blackwood</i>
and the <i>Quarterly</i> in their palmy days, put
an end to our painful conversation. As the field
were returning with the ball, she bent over the
wheels to tell her brother Charlie, in a not inaudible
undertone:</p>

<p>“Forty-three overs, twelve maidens, eighty-nine
runs, one wicket. Sounds good don’t it. ’Nother
wicket’d be a rather nice idea. Trying bowling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
left hand Charlie,—couldn’t be worse than
Tommy’s plough-and-harrow-agricultural-produce
anyhow.”</p>

<p>The Harrow captain hearing this was observed
to display some colour, and march hastily out of
earshot. But a worse fate awaited him on his
arrival at the crease.</p>

<p>The Humourist, having hit his first ball for six in
his playful way, proceeded to treat his second with
a similar levity by lifting that over the pavilion.
This, however, did not appeal in the least to
Harrow’s sense of humour. Therefore, when its
captain pitched his third ball ridiculously short,
the gentle Humourist had time to wait and sweep
it round to the square-leg boundary. But it was
not here that the youthful Tom’s humiliation ended.
The Humourist walked sedately down the wicket
to the bowler’s end, and proceeded to pat down
the turf near the bowler’s foot.</p>

<p>“’Serves him jolly well right,” said Miss Grace
hotly, “it’ll teach these public school cubs not
to be so jolly cheeky.”</p>

<p>But here the spirit of compassion suddenly appeared
in the victim’s sister. Her eyes showed
that she also resented the liberties thus taken with
a member of her family. “I tell you what though,”
she added as an afterthought; “it strikes me that
that Merryweather of yours is a pretty big piece<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
of a brute. Poor old Tommy! I wish he’d bowl
him.”</p>

<p>For some little time, however, the Humourist
went on his way rejoicing. He swiped two of
Charlie’s best, high over the head of cover-point,
in the most amazing manner, and it was only
when in the exuberance of his heart that he
tried to serve a yorker in a similar fashion, that
the honour of the Trenthams was avenged. The
playful Humourist had included two sixes and
three fours in his twenty-eight.</p>

<p>“Why don’t Halliday declare,” said the poor
Optimist, overborne with the knowledge that he
must go forthwith and put his pads on.</p>

<p>“Yes, why don’t he?” said Miss Grace.</p>

<p>“We’ve not got a bit of bowling,” said I.</p>

<p>“But our batting’s not very clever, you know,”
said Miss Grace enticingly.</p>

<p>“Really,” said I. “But then some of us looked in
this morning’s <i>Sportsman</i>, and from our point of
view it didn’t read pretty.”</p>

<p>“But what price the bowling?” said Miss Grace
more coaxingly than ever. “Notts is almost <i>too</i>
awful, an’ Yorkshire’s a bit fluffy on a plumb
pitch. As for Household Brigade and Gentlemen
o’ Cheshire, I wouldn’t mind an hour or two myself
of their sort—just about my weight. <i>Do</i> hope
Halliday’ll declare. Great error if he don’t. Our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
men are so tired, too; you might scuttle us like
fun.”</p>

<p>“Or we mightn’t,” said I callously. “And I
can’t help thinking that we mightn’t. Halliday
will be well advised to go for the record. Of
course, if we’d got some bowling, we’d be at you
like a shot.”</p>

<p>The Captain was plainly of my mind, for he gave
no sign, and the unhappy Optimist, much against
his inclination, climbed down from the box, and
wended his way to the pavilion.</p>

<p>“Why did Jack put me in so early?” his agonised
expression said. “He knows I always like
to go in tenth.”</p>

<p>The General Nuisance reigned in the stead of the
Humourist now. Though the General Nuisance
might be mistaken for an utter fiend in private
life, his batting on hard grounds was angelic.
People who had not to support the personal acquaintance
of the Honourable John Blenkinsop-Comfort
were often heard to inquire why he had
never got his “blue,” and why his exquisite batting
was not more generally recognised by the authorities.
It is no desire of mine to betray anybody’s
confidences, but I feel sure the authorities <i>must</i> have
had very excellent reasons. No doubt, as in the
melancholy case of Miss Grace and Harrow School,
they felt that somewhere they were bound to draw
the line.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>“390 up, boy!” called Miss Grace. The next
over she broke into mirth of a most undisguised
character. “Toddles is going on,” she said. “I’ll
put that in my diary.”</p>

<p>Forthwith producing a small book from her
pocket, she inquired for the date, and placed this
pleasant fact in the annals of the world.</p>

<p>“Well, there’s one thing to be said for Toddles’
bowling,” said its historian. “It can’t be called
derogatory to his cloth. It’s just the stuff a parson
should roll up.”</p>

<p>“Why?” I asked in my innocence.</p>

<p>“There’s no devil in it,” said Miss Grace.</p>

<p>“Oh!” I said. I subsided.</p>

<p>The Reverend Mr. Elphinstone’s deliveries were
slow, simple-minded toss-ups of the most innocuous
kind. The Pessimist and the General Nuisance
having helped themselves to twenty-seven in two
overs, the patentee and sole manufacturer of this
sort of bowling was incontinently shunted for Captain
George, who gallantly went on with lobs.
The happiness of that intrepid officer’s sister was
good to observe.</p>

<p>“Dear simple soul,” she said. “That’s just old
George. <i>So</i> ingenuous you know. Look at him,
rolling up his sleeves and setting out the field.
If this ground’s big enough to hold old George,
he’s altered lately. Now watch, he’s beginning his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
run. Oh, hang it, I’ve left my kodak on the billiard
table. What lovely sights you <i>do</i> see when you
haven’t got your kodak! Old George really ought
to keep his bowling in a show, you know. It’s so
<i>sudden</i>, so <i>unexpected</i>! It reminds me of those
‘Odes in Contribution to the Jolly Song, of the
Jolly Something,’ that the Guv’nor’s got. I say,
do look at him. There he goes—the dear old
boy!—a hop, a stride, another hop, another stride,
a double jump, and then he chucks up the innocentest
cuckoo that you ever saw.”</p>

<p>His first ball came into collision with a tankard
of beer in the refreshment booth; but it would
be kinder to draw the veil of reticence around
the gallant Captain’s trundling.</p>

<p>It was now something after five, the Little
Clumpton score was 440 for four wickets, and the
bowling of proud Hickory was dead, and longing
for a quiet funeral. To see this haughty eleven,
footsore, weary, limp, and very cross, not troubling
to save the boundary, failing to back up, keeping
the bowler waiting while they crossed over, was
a sermon in itself on the instability of human
triumphs and the cussedness of cricket. Five
members of their side had totalled 727 between
them the previous day, but now those five in
common with their less gifted colleagues, were
compelled to expiate their severities in as vigorous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
a leather-hunting as ever a team submitted to.
And, to aggravate their pains, they knew quite
well that on this occasion, Little Clumpton’s so-called
bowling was an object of derision. The
sight of these world-famed batsmen limping round
the boundary, and repeatedly extracting the ball
from a sharp-tongued and not too sympathetic
multitude, was perilously like one of the ironies
of life strained to the point of pathos. But as I
have no desire to wallow in the pathetic, leaving
that to my intellectual betters, let me touch as
lightly as I can on the tragedy of Hickory. Let
it suffice that the Pessimist and the General
Nuisance remained at the wickets cutting, driving,
leg hitting, and showing off their wrist work till
stumps and the match were drawn. As a new
record had been set up in Little Clumpton <i>v.</i>
Hickory, I think it justifiable to reproduce the full
score as it appeared in the <i>Sportsman</i> the following
morning. The bowling analysis is withheld, however,
out of compassion for Miss Grace, who took
the matter so very much to heart, that a young
person less sound in her constitution, and less right
thinking in her mental habitudes, might perhaps
have kept her bed in consequence for several days.
As I have carefully copied this score out of my
commonplace book, its correctness is guaranteed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br>

Cupid puts his Pads on</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">I &#160;WENT home, and passed an unquiet night. I
like to think myself a person of a sturdy unemotional
habit whom neither men nor affairs can
discompose; but I’m certain that every time I fell
into a doze, I was dreaming of brown holland. And
when I lay awake I was thinking of brown holland.
It is very chastening when the proud are smitten
in their self-esteem. Hitherto I had held my invincibility
to be quite glorious. The most fanciful
dressing of the hair, the most fearful wonderful
“creation,” the most ingratiating small talk, I
delighted to defy. It pleased me to think, that I
had a mind as much above cut, colour, carriage and
address, and whole magazines of blandishment, as
any this side professed misogyny. And I was
reasonably gratified with this high behaviour. Be
sure it is no little thing for a young and pretty
eligible bachelor to look, to admit, and yet to remain
impervious. There was some consensus of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
opinion I believe amongst the manias of the county
that young Mr. Dimsdale really ought to settle
down. You should know that young Mr. Dimsdale
having completed his education by a rather liberal
course of globe-trotting, had come home at last to
play the squire at his late father’s little place in
the country. Therefore his late father’s little place
was desiring a mistress; his late father’s little income
was clamouring to be spent. His late father
had been in trade it is true—he had boiled soap, to
be precise; Dimsdale’s Dirt Defier, don’t you know?
But young Mr. Dimsdale himself was so much
the thing, that these charitable ladies would never
be able to forgive themselves if through any fault
of theirs he married something “impossible”—an
actress say, or one of those dreadful pushing
pig-sticking Americans!</p>

<p>I struck a match, and looked at the time. Twenty
minutes past two. I sat up in bed, and said confidentially
to the bedroom furniture:</p>

<p>“Damn brown holland!”</p>

<p>It must have been somewhat embarrassing for
the bedroom furniture I know, but then the thing
was getting serious. I was beginning to fear that
something had gone wrong with the works.</p>

<p>Now the case would not have been quite so
singular had it been a question of a brand-new
gown from Paris. But a humble countryfied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
brown holland! Ah! but was it quite so humble
and so countryfied? Wasn’t there a sweeping
decision in its build that had “Redfern” on it as
legibly as the box in which it came. In fact, the
more I meditated on this unpretentious brown
holland, the more imposing did it grow. By Jove!
it was not half so insignificant as it seemed. In
no time I had discovered so many potential charms
in its deceitful simplicity, that presently its individuality
was merged in that of its wearer.
Redfern—good people—beauty no end—weekly
refusals—earls, etc.—great cricketing family—brother
going out with Stoddart—father awful big
pot—no earthly—who was I—silly ass—soap-boiler’s
son—not even invited to play for the
county—out for seven—couldn’t bat for nuts—why
didn’t I go to sleep—brown holland—damn
brown holland—sleep so much more desirable—what
price her eyes—what was the name of that
complexion—wonder if my batting was likely to
come on—Archie a pretty fair rustic bat—wonder
why all girls didn’t wear brown holland—Zingari
colours didn’t look so dusty with that hair—was
I ever going to sleep—who said brown holland—should
be sure to see her again—Hickory Rectory
was just a nice walk—why wasn’t I a county
cricketer—rather a pretty name Grace—suited her
too! I fell into another doze and dreamt of going<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
in first with Halliday to bat against Middlesex
at Lords. I was so nervous and excited that I
could hardly walk. When I asked the umpire in
a hoarse voice for my guard, and he turned his
face towards me, I saw with horrified surprise that
he wore brown holland underneath his white coat,
and that he had the voice and face of a lady.
When she said, “Your bat’s horribly wobbly;
Charlie’ll get through that like fun,” the shock
was too great to be borne, and I woke up in a
sweat.</p>

<p>I was such a dismal dog and my appetite was so
delicate, that I breakfasted on tea and toast, and
actually elected to peruse a stern indictment of the
Government’s Foreign Policy in the <i>Times</i> rather
than the <i>Sportsman’s</i> account of yesterday’s county
matches. I was sick of cricket. It was such an
unsatisfactory game. Besides, it was of no service
to the liver. I was certain that that important
organ had gone wrong again. Must have advice
about it, and do more riding. Sell my bats or
burn them, and devote myself to polo. Capital
idea!</p>

<p>I was sipping my tea reflectively, and tracing
the strange resemblance of its colour to the complexion
of the young person in brown holland,
when the General Nuisance obtruded his hateful
presence through the open window, as his wont<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
was, without any ceremony whatever. He was
reeking of self-satisfaction and tobacco smoke.</p>

<p>“Don’t mind if I do,” said he, casting his lighted
cigarette on the carpet in a way that promised
to ignite it. Pouring himself out a cup of coffee,
without waiting to be invited, he said:</p>

<p>“Look pretty chippy this morning, my son. Still
fretting about that l.b.w.?”</p>

<p>“Drink your coffee and cut,” said I, as impolitely
as I could.</p>

<p>“Want to be alone, eh?” said he. “Why that’s
a symptom. Let’s see your tongue. And I’d better
feel your pulse.”</p>

<p>“You’ll probably feel my boot,” said I.</p>

<p>“Very prettily expressed,” said the General
Nuisance. Thereon he seated himself on a corner
of the breakfast-table, and seemed certain to capsize
the bacon-dish every time he swung his legs.
“Most incisive and direct.”</p>

<p>“Will be,” said I, not so irrelevantly as it may
appear.</p>

<p>“I’ll prescribe for your disease,” said he.</p>

<p>“You can go to hell,” said I.</p>

<p>“Well,” said he suavely, “my prescription is in
that direction too. I want you to go and drown
yourself. You’re in love.”</p>

<p>“Who told you?” I shouted.</p>

<p>How singular it was that I had not had the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
faintest suspicion till that moment that love was
the name of my disease! But when the General
Nuisance clapped a name upon my malady, not for
an instant did I doubt him.</p>

<p>“Hard that a man of your fine presence should
suffer from hallucinations,” said that glibly hateful
person. “Must feel pretty squiffy. You go
and drown yourself, my pilgrim. Quite the nicest
death in summer. Water beautifully warm. Besides,
you’ve got a pretext in your l.b.w. Jury’ll
bring in a ‘temporarily insane’ without any coarse
remarks. Now then, go away and die. And
what an awfully swagger corpse you’d make.
They’re not always so well nourished and full of
blood, you ostentatious idiot.”</p>

<p>“Who told you I was in love?” said I.</p>

<p>“Your looks,” said he.</p>

<p>“Are they very descriptive?” said I apprehensively.</p>

<p>“Narrative powers of Dickens and Thackeray,”
said he, lighting a fresh cigarette. “Decent girl
though.”</p>

<p>“Decent!” said I, clenching my fist in my enthusiasm;
“she’s the magnificentest girl you ever
saw!”</p>

<p>“Strange,” said he, “how all the objects of our
affection suffer from superlatives.”</p>

<p>“She’s not an object,” said I fiercely, “she’s a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
perfect angel. If you knew her, you’d say she was
too good to live. And such eyes too!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Granny, what big ears you’ve got!” said
he; then dropping his tone, “you excite my fears,
old chap. ’Devilish cut up to find your nervous
system in such a disorganized condition.”</p>

<p>“Don’t spill your phrases all over the place,”
said I. “You’re not in Parliament yet.”</p>

<p>“<i>You’re</i> putting up for Elysium, I see,” he said.
“Don’t think you’ll get in though. Rival candidates
too strong.”</p>

<p>“Who?” I said faintly.</p>

<p>“Right Honourable Earl Boughey for one,” he
said.</p>

<p>“He can’t bat though,” I said.</p>

<p>“His acres compensate.”</p>

<p>“She’s not that kind of girl,” I said quickly.</p>

<p>“They never are—until you get left! Then
there’s the cherished, respectable Optimist.”</p>

<p>“Poor old soul, he’s got no earthly!”</p>

<p>“How sad! But sit on your pity and keep it
snug. It’ll be needed for another, or woman has
changed since my time. Don’t you know that
every sanguine temperament in the shire is similarly
bent? She’s at home the first Monday and
the third Friday for the purpose of dispatching
’em. Does ’em in detachments. As Archie pathetically
says, ‘To a peaceable and quiet mind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
the slaughter is distressing.’ And she’s going to
be a sister to ’em all. Archie says he can’t
sleep o’ nights for thinking of his poor relations.”</p>

<p>“Don’t care,” said I doggedly; “she’s A 1.”</p>

<p>“Rather liberal-minded too.”</p>

<p>“The best women always are.”</p>

<p>“Out of the mouths of babes! But this’ll
gladden you. Middlesex man, stylish, dashing bat,
fair change bowler, irreproachable field, is the dark
horse. Were you only he, the deity might deign.
But as you are merely a club-man with ambitions,
be advised, and go and pack your brain in
ice. For these cases the cold water cure has the
highest testimonials. I’m speaking plain, because
it pains me to see Joyous Imbecility riding for a
fall. So long as it tumbles on its head there’s no
harm done. Besides, the vanity that lives there
sometimes gets a jog. But if it drops on top of
its emotions, it’s been known to write a book, and
that, my pilgrim, in the interests of humanity I
feel it my duty to discountenance.”</p>

<p>The General Nuisance having disposed of his
piece of news, and having trampled on my feelings
as far as considerations for his personal safety
would permit, dismounted from the table in a way
that involved the overturning of the hot-water
dish on to my fox terrier, lying inoffensively on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
hearthrug. Thereon he took his leave, professing
deep solicitude for my deplorable condition, and
departed to advertise it to the world.</p>

<p>Poets always lead one to understand that the
tender passion is an ecstatic, quick-breathing sort
of thing. But in this present case of mine it
simply made me morose and brooding, with a
distinct tendency to put me off my ordinary game.
Loss of appetite, a general lassitude, moodiness,
abstraction, and an instability of purpose that
would not let me do any one thing for more than
five minutes at a time, were a few of my symptoms
on this memorable morning. I loafed about the
fields throughout the forenoon with no other companion
than the Rubaiyat of Mr. Rudyard Kipling—I
am sure I beg your pardon, I mean of course,
the Rudyard Kipling of Mr. Omar Kháyyám—for
once despising sporting literature, as I had
discovered that sport itself was such a hollow, unsatisfying
thing. On coming back to lunch I found
that my sister Mary had returned from town. To
my shame be it said I did not know whether to be
glad or sorry. Mary is a most sympathetic person,
but at the same time I was craving just now for
a life of solitude.</p>

<p>“Had a good time?” said I, immediately on the
top of the fraternal ceremony.</p>

<p>“Yes, and no,” said Mary, in a way that the best<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
girls have. Yes, to imply that she really had had
a good time; no, to suggest that she was not insensible
to her severance from a loving brother.
A mere man would have been incapable of summing
up the exigencies of the moment in this
wholly admirable fashion.</p>

<p>“But, Ricky,” said she, placing her hands on
my shoulders and looking into my face with tremendously
embarrassing intentness, “what’s the
matter with you? You look quite old and weary.
You didn’t get a duck yesterday.”</p>

<p>“I only got seven,” said I, seeking to creep out
on a subterfuge.</p>

<p>“Yes, I bought a <i>Sportsman</i>,” said Mary. “Leg
before’s very annoying, I know, but you mustn’t
let it wreck your health.”</p>

<p>“But mine was the only single figure,” said I,
to still further disarm suspicion.</p>

<p>But all this time Mary’s penetrating glance had
never left my dissembling countenance; and when
she said, in a rather downright manner, “Look
here, Ricky, I don’t think it’s that at all,” I was not
a bit surprised by her profundity, although it did
not prevent me looking guilty.</p>

<p>“They’ve not invited you to play against Somerset
next week?” she asked, with bated breath;
“because if they have I can understand it.”</p>

<p>“No,” I said, “they’ve not.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>“Then I think they’re very mean,” said Mary;
“but what <i>is</i> the matter, Ricky?”</p>

<p>Now Mary had a way with her that I never
could resist. Besides here is a difference between
the sexes. We have only one way of getting to
know anything we want to know, and that is
blunt demand; but a woman has five thousand
ways or more, mostly indirect, to make the Sphinx
unfold its bosom. Therefore it was a rule of
mine to accept the inevitable straight away in the
case of Mary. Sooner or later she was bound
to catch me napping, besides, an early concession
spared us both a vast amount of trouble.</p>

<p>“Do you know Laura Trentham?” said I desperately.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said Mary.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t you call her no end of a nice girl?”</p>

<p>“She’s a very dear girl,” said Mary warmly.
“Quite one of the nicest girls I know—if she
wouldn’t talk slang.”</p>

<p>“Slang!” said I. “Why, <i>does</i> she talk slang?”</p>

<p>“Dreadfully,” said Mary, in that tone of high
reproof that the best sisters are so fond of.
“Dreadfully, Ricky. Isn’t it a pity?”</p>

<p>“Awful,” said I. “S’pose slangy women are
awfully beastly.”</p>

<p>“They’re <i>outrées</i>,” said Mary. “Besides, men
like it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>“Don’t think they know what slang is,” said
I. “S’pose it’s the same as the split infinitive—sort
o’ thing that everybody likes to jolly well jaw
about and don’t know what it is.”</p>

<p>“My <i>dear</i> Ricky,” said Mary sternly. Her eye
fairly flashed with the Higher Culture, therefore I
hastened to dismiss a subject on which she had
such strong opinions.</p>

<p>“I met Laura Trentham yesterday, at the Hickory
match, you know,” said I guiltily.</p>

<p>“Hadn’t we better begin lunch?” said Mary.
“Travelling’s made me so hungry.”</p>

<p>It was well for Mary that her patience had no
limits, for during that meal I consumed incredible
quantities of this invaluable article. However, I
felt perhaps a thought more cheerful for the energy
and colour of my language. But Mary’s last
word was:</p>

<p>“Ricky, I’m so sorry that Laura Trentham does
talk slang.”</p>

<p>I lost no time in seeking the open air. Indoors
I breathed with difficulty, and was, moreover, ridiculously
restless. I wandered aimlessly about the
fields of sunshine, without noting in the least the
direction that I took. I meandered across blistering
meadows to the neighbouring village of Nowhere-in-Particular.
A singularly disordered mind
was my one companion. And such was its condition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
that I neither heeded my direction nor the
landmarks by the way. Therefore, when in the
course of two hours’ rambling it suddenly occurred
to me that it would be as well to observe where
I was, and set my face for home, I should not
have been very surprised to find that I had strolled
off the map of England. Where was I? There
was a low hedge directly ahead. Beyond that I
could indistinctly see, trees being intermingled with
them, glass-houses, out-houses, and an ivy-grown,
ancient manor-house. Whose place was this? Next
instant I shook with hollow laughter at myself.
It was Hickory Rectory, Miss Grace’s home. This
was really too preposterous. The ivy-grown arrangement
just in front was Hickory Rectory for
all that. And the family were still at home, and
apparently engaged in their principal vocation.
For even as I stood girding at my own absurdity,
a voice came from the other side the hedge to this
effect: “Grace, if you will keep covering the sticks
every time with your confounded skirt, you’ll be
out petticoat before.”</p>

<p>“Oh, shall I!” said the audacious person thus
addressed. “If you can’t bowl me, you’d better
bowl for catches and get me caught. Put Toddles
on. He might get me collared in the long-field
like anything.”</p>

<p>Although I was still applying cynical laughter to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
my infernal folly, I was quite prepared to seize the
opportunity of seeing great men in private life,
and that other surpassing member of their family
showing them how things should be done. Therefore
I found myself gazing with both eyes over
the hedge on to the Rectory lawn. It was a single
wicket match. Grace herself was batting. A. H.
was bowling slow breaks; Captain George was
keeping wicket; Elphinstone was in the country;
T. S. M., H. C., and Carteret were all disposed
on the leg-side; whilst an old, foxey-looking individual
was acting in the responsible capacity of
umpire. I had not been there a minute ere Miss
Grace, in attempting a tremendous blind swipe
right off her middle over the cucumber frame at
deep square-leg, was saved by her skirt from
being clean bowled.</p>

<p>“How’s that?” cried A. H., lustily.</p>

<p>“Not hout!” cried the umpire, in a tone that
plainly told A. H. what he, the umpire, thought of
him as a man and a gentleman.</p>

<p>“Very good decision, Biffin,” said Miss Grace,
calmly patting down the turf to show that the ball
had turned a bit. However, Nemesis waited on
Miss Grace next ball. With another mighty swipe
she fetched a real good one round like lightning,
and the youthful T. S. M., fielding short-leg, jumping
up, effected a wonderful one-handed catch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>“Well, what a fluke!” cried Miss Grace; “that
would have been the winning hit.”</p>

<p>“But isn’t,” said Elphinstone, alias Toddles,
cheerfully; “and Surrey have beaten Middlesex
by two runs. First defeat of the champion county.
Oh, Stoddy, why weren’t you steadier?”</p>

<p>“Yes, why weren’t you steadier, Stoddy?” said
Carteret.</p>

<p>“’Cause I didn’t think there was anybody in this
parish who could catch anything after yesterday’s
exhibition,” said the famous Middlesex batsman
dejectedly.</p>

<p>“What’s the next fixture in the Middlesex list?”
asked Captain George.</p>

<p>“Middlesex <i>v.</i> Gloucestershire at Cheltenham,”
said Miss Grace. “Same sides. Let’s toss for
innings.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got a man more than we, though,”
said T. S. M.</p>

<p>“As you play for Harrow, Tommy, you count
two you know,” said Miss Grace.</p>

<p>“Hullo, there’s Dimsdale here,” cried H. C.,
as his eye lit on me. “He’s just the man we
want for Gloucester. Go round, Dimsdale, to the
gate.”</p>

<p>A minute later I was on the Rectory lawn,
and preparing to engage in my first county match.</p>

<p>“As it’s Gloucestershire,” said George the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
kindly, “somebody’ll have to represent the Old
Man. Now Grace herself is the only one with
any pretensions to do that. Suppose Middlesex
swaps her for me?”</p>

<p>“Ripping good idea!” said that celebrated
person eagerly. “That’s stunning! Biffin, just
go and fetch me that red and yellow cap, while
I go out and toss with Mr. Stoddart.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br>

My First County Match</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MIDDLESEX won the toss, and elected to
go in. Archie put on his pads and went
in first, on a distinctly creditable wicket. Grace
captained Gloucestershire, of course.</p>

<p>“As Roberts is suffering from a strain,” said
she, “and Charlie Townsend’s lost his length,
and Jessop’s a bit on the short side at present,
I think I’d better try myself to start with.
Besides, I can get old Archie out.”</p>

<p>She began with very slow, high-tossed, half
volleys. Considering that Archie was one of the
most powerful hitters in England, this proceeding
on the part of W. G. savoured of cool cheek.</p>

<p>“These are no use, you know,” said the batsman,
driving one terrifically hard along the
ground for a big single.</p>

<p>“You hit ’em and see,” said the wily bowler.
“If you do, Archie, sure as a gun you’ll put ’em
through the library windows.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>Grace had shown her hand with a vengeance.
The library windows were sufficiently far away
to be likely to receive one of Archie’s best hits.
It was plain that this knowledge rendered the
batsman very uneasy. Invitingly simple balls,
that he would have taken a mild pleasure
in lifting into the Lords’ pavilion, he felt bound
to treat with every respect, as a momentary indiscretion
was likely to have the direst consequences.
But presently the flesh was no longer
to be denied. Having patiently withstood the
insidious charms of six or seven, his self-repression
suddenly gave way, and, exactly as the bowler
anticipated, smash went the ball through the
library windows. It was vain that Elphinstone,
celebrated out-field as he was, attempted to get
at it. A painfully significant crashing of glass
testified to the unfailing judgment of W. G. A
moment later, to the consternation of every witness
of the incident, out came the reverend occupant
of the library, spectacted and bareheaded,
<i>The Times</i> newspaper fluttering in his hand, and
a great indignation hovering about him generally.</p>

<p>“I positively won’t have it!” he cried in his
deepest tones. “It’s shameful! Do you know
what that window’s worth? And are you aware
that you’ve damaged the new <i>Encyclopædia
Britannica</i>?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>“Well, father,” said W. G. penitently, “we are
all of us ever so dreadfully sorry,” and then made
haste to append, “but you know you bought
the Cycling—what-do-you-call-it—quite against my
advice, didn’t you, father? Don’t believe in these
great bargains. You men don’t either, do you?”</p>

<p>“Oh no, we don’t,” chimed everybody, with
wonderful conviction and unanimity.</p>

<p>“I knew you didn’t,” said Grace, with great
enthusiasm. “I was certain that you didn’t.”</p>

<p>Our extreme distrust of the <i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i>,
considered as an investment, grew quite
noticeable.</p>

<p>Incredible as it may seem, however, Miss Grace’s
parent did not allow these earnestly-expressed
opinions to bias his own in the matter of window
breaking. Indeed, they were as fervently uttered
as ours, and, if anything, more pointed. Nor did
he abate in his behaviour, nor did his <i>Times</i>
cease its fluttering till he suddenly observed the
situation of the wicket, and the mighty cricketer
beside it. Thereupon the change in his demeanour
was as instant as it was welcome.</p>

<p>“What!” he cried, “was it hit from there?
Extraordinary, most extraordinary! Archie, let
me feel that bat. And, Biffin, will you please
fetch the tape. This must be measured. Considerably
more than a hundred yards, I’ll wager.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>Next moment he was brandishing Archie’s
bat, in a manner that plainly said that this was
not the first bat handle that had exercised his
grip.</p>

<p>“A Warsop, is it?” said the veteran. “I remember
’em. Once remember putting old Mat
Kempson out of Prince’s with one of Ben’s. Old
Matthew <i>was</i> annoyed. Beautifully balanced this
is. Must be every ounce of two-seven, yet it
picks up like two-two.”</p>

<p>“It’s two-seven and a half, sir,” said Archie,
with a particularly pleased expression.</p>

<p>“It’s a pretty bit o’ wood,” said the old gentleman,
with caresses in his tone. “A pretty bit
o’ wood. I think I’d like to try it. Laura, just
send me one along. Nice and slow, please; my
eyesight’s not what it used to be.”</p>

<p>This request made his daughter a very proud
and happy person. Having instructed Toddles,
in imperious language, to recover the ball <i>at once</i>
from the library <i>débris</i>, and he having instantly
obeyed, she said:</p>

<p>“All right, father; here you are. Mind the
‘work.’ There’s an awful lot o’ stuff on,” and
bowled him one of her very best. This the old
gentleman kept out of his wicket stiffly but skilfully.</p>

<p>“It strikes me that father can give us all a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
point or two yet,” said Miss Grace, evidently
charmed with the way in which he had defended
his wicket.</p>

<p>“He’d still be playing for Middlesex if it were
not for his eyesight,” said the best bowler in
England.</p>

<p>“It’s my sciatica, Charlie; it’s my sciatica!”
sighed the old gentleman. “When I was your
age, my boy, it was different.”</p>

<p>The return of Biffin with the tape measure
prolonged this interruption to the game. For it
was not until old Mr. Trentham had arrived by
mensuration at the exact distance of Archie’s
drive, that he retired in high good humour to
his shattered library. Even then before the game
could be resumed there was a legal argument
involved. Gloucestershire argued under “Rectory
rules” that, in the event of any batsman breaking
a window, or hitting a ball over the hedge, or
sending it on to the garden twice in one innings,
the said batsman should be out. They acted on
the expert advice of W. G., who, as the irreverent
Toddles said, knew every move on the board,
and one or two that were under it. Middlesex
disclaimed all knowledge of the clause in question,
and T. S. M. even had the audacity to suggest
that it was an invention of W. G.’s to suit
the present occasion. W. G., of course, very indignantly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
denied this, and, fortunately for her
side, was able by a simple expedient to prove
beyond controversy that the attitude of Middlesex
was quite inadmissible, and entirely opposed to
the best interests of the game. For, running
into the house, she triumphantly returned with a
dog’s-eared and time-stained exercise book, wherein,
under rule seven, duly set forth in a large, round,
juvenile hand, it was found that Archie was
most certainly out.</p>

<p>“Won’t it look a bit queer, though?” said
T. S. M. “A. H. Trentham, broke window,
bowled W. G. Grace, three?”</p>

<p>“He shouldn’t be so reckless,” said W. G.
severely. “Besides, it won’t look queerer than
A. H. Trentham sent the ball on the garden twice.
The idea of Rectory rules is to sit on brute force
a bit you know, and to prop—to propa—just
wait while I look in the book. Yes, here it is,
‘and to encourage the propagation and cultivation
of pure science.’”</p>

<p>“Which rendered into modern English means,”
said Carteret, who, in his spare time, was a
barrister, “that the aim of the Rectory rules is
to get the other side out as soon as ever you
can, and then keep in yourself until you’ve had
enough. That’s about it, Grace, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“No, James,” said that authority; “it’s just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
where you’re wrong. ’Cause some people never
have had enough. I’ve not for one.”</p>

<p>“She’s as bad as Ranjy for battin’,” said the
Harrow captain. “Set’s shillin’s on her sticks,
and tempts Biffin to sweat away at ’em till he’s
set up heart disease. Dirt mean, I call it.
Ought to be half-crowns for a man his years.”</p>

<p>“You’re not likely to give anything heart
disease in knocking tips off your sticks, are
you, Tommy?” said his sister persuasively.</p>

<p>Harrow liked not this at all. Therefore, when
a serious flaw in Gloucestershire’s line of argument
occurred to T. S. M., his face lit up with a sudden
satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Perhaps Doctor William Gilbert Grace’ll tell
us,” said he, dwelling lovingly on every word,
“If accordin’ to the blitherin’ rules a fellow’s
out every time he breaks a window, why she
don’t go out herself every time she breaks the
cucumber frame.”</p>

<p>The Harrow captain ended amidst the approving
shouts of Middlesex.</p>

<p>“That’s amongst your timber, Willy,” said the
Rev. Mr. Elphinstone, executing a <i>pas seul</i> in the
middle of the pitch.</p>

<p>“Oh, is it?” said the dauntless W. G. “You
just hold on a bit. A window is a window, and
a cucumber frame’s a cucumber frame.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>“A Daniel come to judgment,” said Archie,
otherwise A. E. Stoddart. “Are there no windows
in a cucumber frame then?”</p>

<p>“Why o’ course there’s not, Archie—I mean,
Stoddy,” said W. G., in a tone that might have
been mistaken for intimidation.</p>

<p>“’May be wrong, you know,” said Archie;
“but in my opinion panes of glass constitute
windows, if they’re fixed in a cucumber frame,
just as much as though they were in a church.”</p>

<p>“Stoddy, <i>you’re</i> talking through your hat,”
said W. G. “A window’s a thing to see out of,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“S’pose it is,” said the Middlesex captain.</p>

<p>“Well, Stoddy,” said the triumphant W. G.,
“just you tell us how cucumber frames <i>can</i> have
windows <i>if cucumbers can’t see</i>.”</p>

<p>Great uproar from Gloucester, during which
the Rev. Mr. Elphinstone was seen to throw himself
full length on the lawn, and roll about in
sheer <i>gaieté de cœur</i>. Even the dignified features
of the Middlesex captain were disturbed by a broad
smile.</p>

<p>“Doctor,” he said, “they’ll have to make you
a baronet yet. Oh, you amusing person!”</p>

<p>“She may be a kind of conscientious objector,
don’t you know?” cried Carteret, the legal
luminary, aiming ineffectual kicks at the rolling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
curate. “Rather think you’d better give the
doctor a certificate of exemption, Stoddy, if Grace’ll
swear solemnly on oath that she conscientiously
believes that cucumbers really cannot see by any
chance or possibility.”</p>

<p>The display of feeling that greeted this solution
of the problem was remarkable. The fat barrister
was hailed as a legal genius.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Archie, screwing his features
into a defiant solemnity, “if the Old Man’ll
swear by her beard that she conscientiously believes
that cucumbers really <i>can’t</i> see, we’ll
insert a special clause into the rules to provide
for the cucumber frame.”</p>

<p>“But I can’t, you know, Archie,” said Miss
Grace, “’cause I’ve got no beard. But I do believe
that cucumbers can’t see all the same
though.”</p>

<p>“This is serious,” said the unrelenting Archie.
“The Old Man without his beard is worse than
Hamlet without the Prince of Denmark.”</p>

<p>“You’ll have to swear on something, Willy,
that’s a cert.,” said Charlie, “else we shan’t
believe you.”</p>

<p>“Somebody fetch a Bible,” said Carteret. “Now
then, Toddles, you idle little beast, why don’t you
go and fetch one of your collection.”</p>

<p>“Let her kiss my hat,” said the little curate,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
suddenly sitting upright on the grass, with a
look of utter holiness that would have made his
vicar glad. “As I’m a parson, it’ll be quite the
truest administration of an oath that’s possible.
Every parson carries the whole contents of the
Scriptures in the lining, all hallowed by his
intellect as well. You know it, brethren, don’t
you? Besides, it’ll save me the fag of going to
the house. Yes, by all means, let her kiss my hat.”</p>

<p>At this suggestion, the solemnity that seized
us all was really marvellous. We had gravity
enough to equip a class for confirmation.</p>

<p>“Jimmy, here’s my hat!” said Toddles. “Isn’t
it a blessing that you’re a commissioner for oaths—horrid
awful ones they are, you fat blasphemer!”—this
in an eloquent aside.</p>

<p>“Here, Grace, is his hat,” said Carteret.</p>

<p>Miss Grace took the Rev. Mr. Elphinstone’s not
very particularly ecclesiastical Harlequin cricket
cap, and looked at it with some dubiety.</p>

<p>“But this is not his hat, James,” said she.
“This is his Harlequin.”</p>

<p>“All the same,” said Carteret judicially. “Embodies
much of his best thought. Look sharp
and swear, Grace! It’s a great strain on us all,
I can assure you, Doctor, even though you mightn’t
think it. These moments of high emotion always
are.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>Nobody laughed I am prepared to affirm. But
before Miss Grace had the oath administered to
her, she looked at the witnesses with a keenness
that inconvenienced several of them rather considerably.
She then proceeded to thoughtfully
scratch her chin.</p>

<p>“James,” said she, in a perplexed tone, “don’t
quite know, you know; not quite sure, you know,
but—but I think you’re <i>having</i> me.”</p>

<p>“Rather think you’re having us,” said Archie.
“Do be quick, Grace! As James says, you don’t
know how difficult it is for us. Look at poor
Toddles worrying the grass.”</p>

<p>“What an emotional little man it is!” said
Captain George with rare sympathy. “And
what a ghastly thing it must be to have such a
high-strung nature.”</p>

<p>“I think you men are laughing at me,” said
Miss Grace sternly.</p>

<p>“She cannot understand us,” said George.
“How sad it is to be misunderstood!”</p>

<p>The poor soldier ended by diving suddenly
and ignominiously for his handkerchief.</p>

<p>“You don’t take me in,” said Grace.</p>

<p>“She won’t kiss Toddles’ cap,” said T. S. M.,
with the brutality of his time of life, “because she
thinks if she holds out long enough she’ll be able
to kiss Toddles himself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>“Tommy!” said his sister, “if you were not
so young, I should think you were rude.”</p>

<p>A second later she added most uncompromisingly,
“And it’s all right. I’m not going to be
had. I’m not going to kiss Toddles’s cap, if it is a
Harlequin, and if he did make a hundred against
Cambridge in it. And I’m not going to take the
oath, and I’m not going to play the giddy ox at
all. Archie, you’re out, under rule seven, and
out you’ve got to go. What’s your opinion,
Biffin? Is Mr. Archie out, or is he not?”</p>

<p>“Hout, miss,” said Biffin. “Hout, most certingly.”</p>

<p>“There you are!” said the Gloucestershire
captain. “Next man get his pads on. And if
he’s not in in two minutes, his wicket’ll be
claimed, under rule forty-five.”</p>

<p>“Well, as the umpire is against me,” said Archie,
“I suppose I shall have to go. All the same,
I think the M.C.C. ought to know about it. These
rules seem a bit unusual.”</p>

<p>“It’s ’cause you’re like the cucumbers, you
know, Archie,” said W. G. “It’s ’cause you
can’t see.”</p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to give a detailed narration
of my first county match. In a little
over an hour the four Middlesex representatives
were disposed of for thirty-three. This was considered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
a small score for the ground; but as both
sides fielded, and very admirably too, and hitting
carried penalties with it, the Middlesex total calls
for no comment. Besides, the Gloucestershire
captain was a remarkably alert tactician, who
knew the game of cricket perfectly well, and the
Rectory rules even better. Her placing of the
field betrayed an intimate acquaintance with the
characteristics of each batsman; and her slow
bowling was perfect in length, and as full of
deception as it possibly could be. It might be
true that Miss Grace had no beard; but it did
not prevent her representing W. G. in most
essentials. Indeed so much so, that when the
youthful Harrow captain came in second wicket,
she was heard to remark, “Oh, he’s a young ’un,
is he! I think I can do for him.” And in
addition to her other gifts, she possessed that
rare but invaluable quality in a captain, of practically
dictating the decisions of the umpire.
There is no doubt that the Gloucestershire captain
was invariably conscientious in her appeals, and
the umpire equally so in his decisions. But their
common faith in one another was beautiful. If
Miss Grace did make an appeal, the excellent
Biffin felt bound to endorse it. In his eyes Miss
Grace’s judgment had an absolute and sovereign
rectitude. Old pro. and county man as he was,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
Biffin had never an opinion of his own on any
point on which Miss Grace happened to already
entertain one. And this phenomenon in itself,
I think, supplies a sufficient reason why the fair
sex has yet to be seen in serious cricket. It
simply would not do.</p>

<p>The fielding was excellent. Miss Grace’s eye
was on it, and all of us, whether we felt inclined
that way or not, performed prodigies of valour.
And if the handsomest girl in the county brings off a
bewilderingly brilliant “caught and bowled” before
one’s eyes, stops the hottest cracks one hand, and
fields and returns smashing hits all in one action,
any man, with the least pretensions to be a player,
is certain to be a bit above himself. Therefore do
not be surprised that my fielding in all positions
was very good indeed, and won encomiums from
men who were accustomed to the best.</p>

<p>“Dimsdale,” said the little curate in a low but
excruciatingly friendly tone, “you stick to that
pick-up and return, and you’ve got the least little
bit of a hundredth part of a look in. Keep as clean
and keen as that, and it’s just on the cards that you
may be adopted as a candidate.”</p>

<p>“Candidate?” said I.</p>

<p>“There was a man named Comfort came over
here to lunch,” said the little curate.</p>

<p>This sinister reference afflicted me with an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
overpowering disinclination to pursue the subject
farther.</p>

<p>Before Gloucestershire began their innings there
was an interval for tea. There is no doubt that this
question of afternoon tea has become quite a vexed
one with the counties, and as Elphinstone—or was
it Carteret?—observed, there are counties in existence
who resolutely refuse to countenance the
innovation. But Gloucestershire was never one
of these. Indeed, I’ve heard it said that when
Gloucestershire are fielding, though the reason is
inexplicable of course, there is more time consumed
over the cup that cheers than on any other occasion.
Therefore in this instance it was quite an
expected thing that there should be a pretty considerable
interval for tea, and that Gloucester’s
captain should lead the way to a fair white table,
seductively spread in the shade of the beeches and
the chestnuts in the coolest corner of the garden.
The Rectory grounds were of no remarkable extent,
but harboured a charming wilderness with two
lawns therein beautifully turfed and mown and
rolled for cricket only, to break the monotony of
shrubs, trees, and flowers, growing at their own
sweet will. If this was the favoured spot in
which this famous family had been reared, and this
the air they breathed, small wonder that they
played cricket as naturally as Keats wrote poetry.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
They couldn’t help it. My enthusiasm demanded
an outlet, and I told Miss Grace that hers was the
most delightful place I’d ever seen.</p>

<p>“Yes, isn’t it just stunning!” she cried, while
her glowing look announced that her chiefest
pleasure was to sing its praises. “Every morning
when I look out of my window and hear the birds
kicking up a jolly noise in the ivy, and see the dew
scooting off the wicket, it seems to come to me all
at once, as if I’d never thought of it before, that I
live at just the primest place that ever was.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it pretty old?” I said.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said she. “Been in our family——”</p>

<p>“Since Noah,” T. S. M. rudely interposed.</p>

<p>“Now then,” said Toddles, “don’t Harrow your
sister’s feelings.”</p>

<p>“Been in our family,” Miss Grace continued,
ignoring these cursory remarks with fine dignity,
“since—since—oh well a long time before cricket
was invented. Been some awful swells here, too,
at one time and another. Old William Lillywhite
once came here to tea. Then one or two other
awful pots have lived here—Edmund Spenser, Sir
Philip Sydney, Joseph Addison, oh! and the girl
who invented round arm bowling.”</p>

<p>“And the girl who invented round arm bowlin’!”
said the Harrow captain. “Now tell us somethin’
else. The girl who invented round arm bowlin’!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
Grace, when you get your jaw unshipped it’s a
pleasure to sit and listen.”</p>

<p>“Yes it was a girl,” said Miss Grace determinedly.
“The Guv’nor’s got a picture of her in
his portfolio. Her name was Willes. What a
good sort she must have been! I just love that
girl. I wish she was living now, ’cause then I
could jolly well go and hug her for inventing
it.”</p>

<p>“Miss Willes knew a thing or two, however,”
said the Harrow captain, “and took care to die in
time.”</p>

<p>This was thought to be so undeserved, that the
youthful Tom was instantly collared low by the
little curate, with all the science, natural and
applied, of a three-quarter who had been capped
for England twice, and flung into a prickly bush
of gooseberries.</p>

<p>“In my opinion,” the little parson hastened to
remark, in an attempt to divert the public mind
from this painful incident, “your place has only
one fault, Grace. It’s just a bit too small.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” said Grace; “I wouldn’t have it
different for worlds. I wouldn’t even have a fly
knocked off it. What there is is perfect. Always
reminds me of you, you know, Toddles—it’s little
and good.”</p>

<p>“My dear Grace,” said the little curate, bowing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
over his cap; “my dear Grace, even I, the meanest
of your servants! But if you believe that your
harrowing youngest brother would benefit in
manners by a heavy fall upon his head, pray let
me hear you say so.”</p>

<p>It was in this amiably Christian spirit that the
representatives of Gloucestershire and Middlesex
came to the tea-table. W. G., of course, presided
and dispensed the tea to the manner born; and the
supplies of strawberries and cream were so prodigious,
indeed almost inexhaustible, that we were
allowed to help ourselves. It may not be generally
known that strawberries and cream are as essential
to the cricket epicure as a hard wicket and a
cloudless heaven. There is something in their
mere flavour that smacks of glorious summer!</p>

<p>We had just begun our depredations, when the
Rector appeared, in a battered wideawake, with a
long hoe in one hand, a cricket ball in the other,
and a particularly stern countenance behind his
perspiration.</p>

<p>“Why, that’s the ball we lost last week!” cried
Miss Grace. “Oh, thank you, father; it is very
good of you to bring it to us. Quite new too.
Only been played with twice.”</p>

<p>“I am very gratified to find that you do recognise
it, Laura,” said the Rector. “When I do happen to
find them amongst the ruins, they are mostly made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
out to come there in the ordinary course of nature,
like the frost and rain; as no one has the least
idea, as a rule, how they could possibly have
arrived by any other agency. Do you know that
you have smashed my best auratum lily in the
most wanton and outrageous manner?”</p>

<p>“Indeed I don’t, father,” said Miss Grace, with a
look of trouble. “You don’t think it could have
been the hedgehog, do you, father?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t think it could have been the hedgehog,
nor the peacock.”</p>

<p>“It might have been the mongoose, don’t you
think?” Miss Grace said; “they’re such awfully
queer and ugly things.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t think it was the mongoose,” said her
parent, “queer and ugly as they are. I think it
was the cricket, and I propose to stop the cricket’s
little game. It’s shameful!”</p>

<p>“What, stop the cricket, sir!” His daughter’s
tone was tragical.</p>

<p>“Yes, stop the cricket. I’ll have no more of it.
It’s simply massacred my tobacco plants. Rows
upon rows I’ve tried to count and can’t, that have
got their tops off and are pounded into snuff.”</p>

<p>“I’m jolly sorry, father,” said Miss Grace. “But
s’pose you have a cup of tea. You look so hot and
fagged. A cup of tea, with lots of cream in, and a
few of the best strawberries that you ever grew.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
Do you see that we’re enjoying ’em a fortnight later
than anybody else?”</p>

<p>“I also see,” said the Rector—not to be diverted
by the tactful feminine—“that my tigridias are
broken into little pieces. The more I think of what
you’ve done, the more annoyed I feel!”</p>

<p>“I am afraid that it’s my hard hitting that’s done
the mischief, sir,” said the great batsman, who was
going out with Stoddart, humbly.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, Archie,” said his sister, “nothing of the
sort. Now I come to think of it, I remember doing
it myself. Look here, father, s’pose you stop my
‘tin’ till the damage has been paid for.”</p>

<p>“That is a punishment that defeats itself,” the
Rector said. “Last time I took that course, these
big brothers of yours, who are old enough to know
better, aided and abetted you to the extent of subscribing
twice the amount of pocket-money that
you were losing. Why, you were able to buy a
new bat out of the profits of your crimes.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” said Miss Grace quickly, “it was good
old George who gave me that. I can’t help old
George being such a good sort, can I?”</p>

<p>“For valour, sir,” said the soldier, “always
admire mettle, even in criminals of the deepest
dye.”</p>

<p>“You are all as bad as one another,” said the old
gentleman, sitting down to tea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>“Father,” said the hostess, “you are sitting next
to Mr. Dimsdale, who’ll soon be playing for his
county. He’s got the loveliest crack to cover that
you ever saw.”</p>

<p>“Very glad to see you, sir,” said the old gentleman,
“and I hope you’ll excuse my display of heat.
It takes a gardener to appreciate my feelings. One
cricket ball in one minute will find more repairs
for Nature than she can get through in a
year.”</p>

<p>“I was thinking to myself, father, when you
interrupted me,” said Miss Grace, “that cricket
nowadays is not what it was in your time. Where
are the great men of your day? There’s no
Haywards and Carpenters now; and there’s no
Tarrants and Willshers. Where is the man that
can bowl like old John Jackson, where is the chap
that can hit to leg like old George Parr?”</p>

<p>It is a very painful thing for a determined
admirer of Miss Grace’s sex to set down in black
and white, but I’m sure that, with one exception,
every man around that festive tea-table instinctively
distrusted Miss Grace’s extremely solemn countenance.
The one exception, incredible as it may
seem, was Miss Grace’s honourable and reverend
papa.</p>

<p>“By Jove!” cried the best bowler in England,
playing his sister’s wicked, unscrupulous game,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
“Grace is right. There’s no stars like there used
to be in the Guv’nor’s time.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Charlie,” said Miss Grace, “I’m very sorry
to say it, but cricket’s going down. Tom Richardson,
Johnny Briggs, Arthur Mold, and Charlie
Trentham are not fit to tie the boots of George
Freeman, Jimmy Shaw, David Buchanan, and
‘The Reverent.’ And the batting too. The Old
Man was in his prime in the seventies, Shrewsbury’s
getting on, and where are you to find
a man with the style of Dicky Daft? and even
Toddles can’t cut like old Eph. Lockwood, and
Archie can’t lift ’em like Charlie Thornton. Cricket
was cricket then. It wasn’t so much like billiards.
Batsmen had to face their luck on all sorts
o’ pitches, whilst now they get their wickets laid
and prepared just like a jolly old foundation
stone.”</p>

<p>It may be that the end justified the means. For
certain it is that Miss Grace’s parent forgot all
about his mutilated garden. The old gentleman
sat and beamed. He began to sip his tea and
talk of other times.</p>

<p>“Ha!” he sighed, “I envy you young dogs. I
<i>should</i> like to have a try at those Australians!”</p>

<p>“Father’s used to curl in the air, you know,”
said his daughter to me proudly. “They’re very
scarce. There’s no man now that can make ’em do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
it quite like the Guv’nor—curl one way and break
another. ’Fairly gave the batsman fits. If Charlie
could only make ’em do it, he’d be the biggest terror
that ever was. Don’t you think so, Father?”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t like to say that,” said the modest old
gentleman. Nevertheless there was a tender approval
in the eye with which he regarded the very
fine fast bowler, who was so busy with his strawberries
and cream.</p>

<p>“That’s right, sir,” said that young man quite
anxiously; “for you really must not encourage
Grace in this curl in the air sort o’ rot, you know.
Whenever she gets me to herself, she whips a ball
out of her pocket and says, ‘Now then, Charlie,
let’s have you at it,’ measures twenty-two yards,
and keeps me trying to find out those patent
swerves of yours for about two hours at a stretch.”</p>

<p>“Better be doing that than smoking horrible
tobacco, or practising the push stroke, or reading
for the law in a pink paper that’s got the starting
prices in it,” said his sister sternly.</p>

<p>“But I say that the Guv’nor’s leg curl can’t be
learnt,” said Charlie. “I say it has to come by
nature.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said his sister, “I don’t care, Charlie,
how you have it come, whether by nature, Pickford’s,
or the Parcel Post. But you’ve got to get it,
Charlie. Just think of the value of it to England<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
and Middlesex. Why, they’d be playing you to
leg and have their middles telescoped like fun
wouldn’t they, Father?”</p>

<p>“I think that’s how I used to effect ’em occasionally,”
said the old gentleman, with a twinkle. “It
used to be said that the All England Eleven once
called a meeting to discuss how these curly twisters
should be played. Some of ’em would lie awake at
nights trying to find out the scientific way. But I
don’t think they ever did. Once I remember bowling
Tom Hayward second ball both innings in one
match, and it made poor Tom so sick that they had
to put leeches on his head.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Dimsdale,” sighed Miss Grace, “I
should like you to have seen old father in his day.
That’s why he’s a D.D., you know. Cambridge
gave it him for his bowling.”</p>

<p>“Really!” I said. “Is that a fact?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the Rector, and I never saw a
man look more mischievous, “I don’t <i>quite</i> think it
was for my learning.”</p>

<p>“Toddles,” said Archie, “Oxford’ll elect you to
a fellowship if you did get a Fourth in Mods.”</p>

<p>“Laura,” said the Rector, “let me assure you
again that I don’t think this curl in the air can be
acquired. Therefore, I should recommend you to
spend your spare time in more profitable employments.
For instance, playing with a perfectly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
straight bat, or weeding the garden, or trying to
read Horace without a crib.”</p>

<p>This was Charlie’s opportunity. For a moment
that boisterous person seemed mightily inconvenienced
by the Homeric laughter that shook his
being.</p>

<p>“What price Grace,” he cried, “spending her
spare time in reading Horace? Why, she only
knows of one chap called Horace in the reading
line, which his other name is Hutchinson.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t I though?” said Grace. “I know
the Horace father means. A fat old bounder who
was always thirsty; awful fond of wine, he was,
awful fond. Don’t think <i>he</i> was ever in condition.
As for his jaw, it was something frightful. Why,
I’ve got a very cultivated literary taste, haven’t
I, Father?”</p>

<p>“Very,” said her parent gently.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I can quite believe that the Guv’nor
strokes your fur a bit,” said Archie, whose insight
into the human heart was pitiless, “when he has
you in on Saturday evenings and wants to persuade
you to fish him a few quotations out of Bohn. We
know where all the embroidery comes from, don’t
we, Toddles?”</p>

<p>“It’s not Bohn, anyhow,” said Miss Grace,
“’cause the binding’s better. Hullo, what’s up
with Toddles! Why, he’s choking!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>It required the undivided energies of two strong
men to beat the little curate on the back ere he was
restored to a sense of his responsibilities.</p>

<p>“I think,” said the old gentleman, with sly enjoyment,
“that these revelations are hardly suited
to the young miss. Feminine ideals, you know.”</p>

<p>At this Miss Grace looked keenly about her
on every side. “It’s all serene, Father,” said she.
“There’s none o’ the maids about. Don’t think
they can <i>possibly</i> hear us.”</p>

<p>“Laura,” said the old gentleman, hiding the most
significant part of his face in a tea-cup, “I want
you to confine yourself in your spare time to learning
to play with a perfectly straight bat. The
way in which you pull everything blindly to leg
is a reproach, a disgrace to the family. You boys
ought to be really ashamed of it, and it grieves
me to think that Laura’s self-respect allows her to
do it. I’m wondering if we had Arthur Shrewsbury
down for a bit whether he’d be able to do
anything for her.”</p>

<p>“It’s her sex asserting itself,” said Archie. (It
should be said at once that Archie has such an
amount of psychology and kindred things in his
mind that he has written a novel for the Keynotes
Series.) “The eternal feminine is not to be repressed.
There’s two things about Grace’s cricket
that betrays the woman. One, as the Guv’nor has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
remarked, is her deplorable habit of playing everything
with a cross bat; the other is a well-defined
tendency to dispute the umpire’s decisions.
Woman-like, she declines to recognise a mere man’s
authority. If it were not for the fear that she’d
have been defying Bob Thoms or some other potentate,
and refusing to go out when he gave her
‘petticoat before,’ we might have played her for
Middlesex, for her bowling and fielding all through
the season.”</p>

<p>“It’s all jolly fine you men ragging me about my
cross bat,” said poor Miss Grace, whose face had
the tawny red of a tea-rose. “But if I was Ranjy,
or Clem Hill, or Archie Trentham, or one of those
big pots, people ’ud say it was a marvellous hook
stroke, and the fruit of my wonderful original
method.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said her enemy of Harrow, “if you were
Ranjy, or Clem Hill, or Archie Trentham, or one
of those big pots, your picture’d be in the Jubilee
Cricket Book, with you in the act of droppin’ ’em
into the cucumber frame. But as you don’t happen
to be Ranjy, or Clem Hill, or Archie Trentham, or
one of those big pots, but Miss Laura Mary, the
cheekiest girl that ever put her hair in pins, your
cross bat is beastly disgusting, and cruel rough on
your people. And if your father don’t send for
Shrewsbury to lick you into shape, we will, because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
you’ve got to be broke in, that’s certin. Whenever
I think about your battin’, Laura,—it’s an insult
to the Old Man to call you Grace,—it makes me
downright sick.”</p>

<p>“Gentlemen,” said the little parson, rising at
this point in the peroration and speaking in his
most clergymanly intonation, “must we not do
our painful duty?”</p>

<p>Whereon five men stood up as one, suddenly took
young Tom from behind, and despite his struggles,
bore him bodily to the biggest and prickliest gooseberry
bush in the vicinity. They deposited him on
the top of it, with what appeared unnecessary violence,
and when he wriggled himself off, he
brought away a rather uncomfortable quantity of
needles in his epidermis.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br>

A Case of Heredity</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN peace had been restored, Captain
George remarked, “<i>Apropos</i> of the Guv’nor’s
curl in the air, it’s very singular and a bit
annoying too that Grace is the only one of us who
has developed it. There’s no doubt that she’s got
it. Don’t you think so, sir?”</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly,” said the old gentleman. “And
I think it is because she delivers the ball with a
stiff arm, just as I used to do. It’s the clearest
case of heredity that I ever saw.”</p>

<p>“If Grace was not a girl,” said Archie, “she’d
be the best bowler in England to-day. That curl
from leg of hers, when it occasionally takes it into
its head to come back from the off after it’s pitched
requires more watching than anything I know.”</p>

<p>“Grace, will you qualify for Kent?” said Carteret.</p>

<p>Miss Grace, although somewhat embarrassed by
the praises of these great men, which caused her to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
blush most adorably, was supremely happy. It
was honey to her to be considered on her merits
as a cricketer.</p>

<p>“I wish this jolly leg curl was Charlie’s instead of
mine,” said its flattered owner in the most unselfish
manner. “What use is it to me? If Charlie’d got
it now, Stoddy’d be obliged to take him with him
in the autumn. Or even if that young cub of a
Tommy had got it, it might get him in the county.”</p>

<p>“If the young cub in question can’t get in the
county without the help of a girl,” said the Harrow
captain, sore but dignified, “he’d prefer to stop
outside, thank you.”</p>

<p>“Boy,” said the little parson, “you must learn
to respect your elders—sisters especially.”</p>

<p>“But she’s my twin,” said T. S. M.</p>

<p>“She’s older than you, though, ever so much
older,” said the oracular Archie. “Girls don’t
begin to grow young until they become women.
Only wait a bit; there’ll come a time when you’ll
find yourself years older than Grace is.”</p>

<p>“But she’s so beas’ly patronisin’,” said poor
T. S. M. “She might be a howlin’ authority on
the game, a reg’ler A. G. Steel, or a chap like that,
instead of a beas’ly girl with the cheek of a female
journalist. I’ll admit she’s got a bit o’ book knowledge,—Badminton,
and all that—and can talk like a
phonograph, but she’s not going to play the apostle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
with me, not if I know it. Her airs are alarmin’.
Don’t know why you men let her rag you, and fag
you, and cheek you, and order you about the show
accordin’ to her imperial pleasure. I’m goin’ to
kick. To me that sort o’ thing ain’t at all amusin’.
Why at Harrow——”</p>

<p>“Yes, at Harrow,” said the little parson eagerly.</p>

<p>“Yes, at Harrow,” said Archie, with a burning
eye.</p>

<p>“Yes, at Harrow,” said every individual person
at the table in the proper order in which he was
seated, with strained intensity.</p>

<p>“I can see you’re all under her thumb,” said the
unhappy T. S. M., reddening to the roots of his
hair. “She just ruffles it over everybody, from the
Guv’nor to the gardener’s boy. And her ways are
simply howlin’. I brought Billy Jowett, who’s in
the same game as me at Har—, yes, in the same
game as me, down here for a week end. And this
nice brought-up sister o’ mine says to him after
he’d been here about a day, ‘I say, Mister Jowett,
isn’t it exhaustin’ to have such brilliant gifts?
Your mama is so proud of you, I’m sure, and how
brave of her to let you come so far from home
without your governess!’ Well, that riled Billy so
cruel that he just cut back by the next train, and
he says that if I ever ask him to come down again
he shall take it as an insult.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>“That’s luck,” said the unabashed Miss Grace.
“The coxey little boy; and he <i>was</i> such an awfully
gifted being! Talked of George Eliot as though he
knew him well. Then he got discussing ‘The Historical
Continuity of the Church of England’ with
the Guv’nor, and then ‘The Inwardness of the
Harmsworth Magazine,’ and housetop talk o’ that
sort. Then he got arguing with the Guv’nor—yes,
<i>arguing</i>, Archie, and once I’m certain that he contradicted
the Guv’nor flat. It just made my blood
<i>boil</i>; and when he said, Archie, ‘that he had been
told that you batted rather well,’ I thought it somewhere
about time that he had a hint.”</p>

<p>“He’s the smartest classic in the school, anyhow,”
said T. S. M. hotly. “Greek and Latin
prizeman, and all that, and he’s going up to Trinity
next term, and he’s certain to get a fellowship,
besides a double blue.”</p>

<p>“He’s big enough bore to get a deanery,” was
Miss Grace’s swift answer.</p>

<p>I grieve to say that the whole table, her reverend
papa included, seemed really charmed with this
audacious speech.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Harrow’s captain, feeling that the
day was going against him, and therefore losing his
head a little, and mixing his metaphors horribly,
“you can curl back into your shell. Your airs
won’t wash with me. And don’t put side on with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
a pitchfork either, for when all’s said, you are
barely an hour older than I am.”</p>

</figure>

<p>“Yes, dear Tommy,” said his sister; “but then,
you see, I’ve not been to Harrow.”</p>

<p>The Fates, however, were now kind enough to
play into the hands of T. S. M. It is almost
certain else that his mutilated corpse had been
carried from this fatal field. A maid-servant
issued from the house with a pink slip in her
hand. She delivered it into the care of the Harrow
captain.</p>

<p>“The boy’s waiting, sir,” said she.</p>

<p>Tom tore off the wrapper. Thereon he was seen
to grow noticeably pale, while he allowed the
telegram to flutter from his fingers.</p>

<p>“I say!” he gasped.</p>

<p>Miss Grace pounced on the pink paper like a
hawk, and read out its contents in a voice thrilling
with excitement: “You are selected for Kent
match, Monday, Tonbridge. Reply paid, Webbe.
Hooray! Hooray! Isn’t A. J. just a darling!”</p>

<p>The exuberant young person waved the telegram
about in such a frantic manner that she overturned
the teapot into the lap of Carteret.</p>

<p>“Terribly sorry, James,” she said breathlessly;
“terribly sorry. But lend me a pencil, somebody,
and, Jane, just see that that boy don’t go.”</p>

<p>A pencil being promptly forthcoming, Miss Grace<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
wrote in a hasty but firm hand on the slip attached:
“Shall be very glad to play, Tonbridge,
Monday. T. Trentham.”</p>

<p>“There you are, Jane,” said she; “give that
to the boy,” and fishing half-a-crown from her
purse, added, “and this is for him, too.”</p>

<p>“Laura, what unwarrantable extravagance,”
said the Rector, looking so happy that he could
scarcely sit still.</p>

<p>“It ’ud be five shillings,” said Miss Grace, “only
I want some new gloves for Tonbridge on Monday.
But isn’t it glorious! Isn’t it tremendous of A. J.!
Tommy, I’m <i>so</i> delighted! And didn’t I say from
the first that they wouldn’t pass you over? And
you will take me to Tonbridge, won’t you, Father?”</p>

<p>“I think you are more likely to take me,” said
that indulgent man.</p>

<p>The whole-hearted joy of them all was infectious.
I might have a dim idea that my own county had
yet to behave in a similar way towards one whom
I held to be peculiarly worthy, but, none the less,
I bore my part in the back thumpings as gallantly
as any. The recipient of these congratulations,
talkative to the point of calamity the moment
before, was now in such a state of miserable happiness
that he could not find a word to say. With
his eyes fixed modestly on his plate he was white
one minute, and red the next. His sister, however<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
determined a foe she might be, was most unmistakably
delighted. After inserting a strawberry into
Elphinstone’s shirt-collar, not necessarily as a
cause of offence, but rather as a guarantee of her
excessive happiness, she ended by falling on her
father bodily, and publicly hugging him.</p>

<p>“Pater,” she said, “you don’t mind, do you?
It is so horribly jolly nice to feel that Tommy’s
playing on Monday, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>About five minutes later the Harrow captain
became the victim of an idea.</p>

<p>“’Ought to reply now, I suppose,” he said nervously.
“’Wonder if the boy’s gone. Would you
say you’d play? What do you say, sir? What
do you say, Grace? How would you word it?
Don’t quite know what to do. Somehow feel I’m
not altogether fit.”</p>

<p>“It’s all right, Tommy; I <i>have</i> replied,” said
his sister. “You’re playing on Monday.”</p>

<p>“It’s beas’ly good of you, old girl,” said her
youngest brother.</p>

<p>“What price Harrow’s principles now?” cried
Carteret. “Here is the man who was not going
to let his sister play the apostle with him. Wasn’t
he going to let her see!”</p>

<p>“Shut up, James,” said Miss Grace, “else
you’ll get some more tea on your togs. Soon as
a fellow plays for the county he gets sense knocked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
into him, and grows into a man quite suddenly.
Now, Tommy, mind no more smoking this week;
early to bed, you know, not a minute after ten;
nice long morning walks, and, perhaps, a Turkish
bath on Saturday. We must have you like—like
a jumping cracker for Monday.”</p>

<p>“Mayn’t I smoke cigarettes?” said the meek
Tommy.</p>

<p>“No, not one,” said his tyrannical sister. “And
I shall put you on oysters and beef-tea. Oh,
and cod-liver oil.”</p>

<p>“Cod-liver oil?” said the prospective county
man. He made a grimace.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” said Miss Grace. “Archie and
Charlie take a tablespoonful a day, don’t you? I
simply insist on it, don’t I?”</p>

<p>“Lord, yes!” groaned those great men.</p>

<p>“S’pose <i>I’ve</i> got to have it, then,” said the
Harrow captain humbly.</p>

<p>From this it should be seen that county cricket
is not quite all beer and skittles. It has its drawbacks.</p>

<p>The enthusiasm had scarcely had time to die
when a solitary figure, in a grey flannel suit, came
through the laurel bushes and over the lawn to
the tumultuous tea-table. It was the Optimist.</p>

<p>“Delighted to see you, my boy,” said the Rector.
“Sit down, and get at those strawberries.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>“One lump or two, Cheery?” said the brisk
Grace. “And Tommy’s playing against Kent on
Monday. Isn’t it scrumptious! Toddles, send the
cream along, will you when you’ve taken your
blazer out of it? But isn’t it prime about
Tommy?”</p>

<p>“Your fist, old man!” demanded the Optimist.
He wrung T. S. M.’s hand in such a way that it
was lucky it was not his bowling arm.</p>

<p>The Optimist, best of good fellows as he was,
might have sought for years to find the highway
into Miss Grace’s heart, and yet not have so nearly
found it as he did just then. For his behaviour
clearly said, that if he was not in his own person
a great cricketer, none the less he had a true
feeling for the game.</p>

<p>As the champion county had made a moderate
score, and Gloucestershire felt that they therefore
could afford to be generous, Brightside was
allowed to bat for Middlesex. Unfortunately,
his efforts in the batting line were of very
little service to his side. When the poor chap
took his guard, and then looked up and saw Miss
Grace preparing to deliver, he couldn’t have been
in a greater funk had she been Spofforth himself.
One ball transacted his business. It had the
paternal curl, and also “did a bit” as well.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m so sorry,” said the tender-hearted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
bowler, as the poor Optimist’s wicket shed a silent
bail; “but it was a good ’un, wasn’t it? The
Old Man’s analysis is three wickets for fourteen.
Not so dusty, is it, for a veteran?”</p>

<p>“Are you counting that broken window a
wicket?” asked the victim of Law Seven, Rectory
Rules.</p>

<p>“What do <i>you</i> think?” said W. G. “If I chuck
you a ’tice, and it leads you to take liberties, what
do you think, Archie?”</p>

<p>“Why, I think your cheek’s increasing,” said
the emphatic Archie.</p>

<p>Grace went in first for Gloucestershire, of
course.</p>

<p>“One leg, Biffin, if you please,” said she, bending
her brown face over her bat handle. “Toddles,
will you have the goodness to come from behind the
bowler’s arm? Oh, and Biffin, you must not forget
that according to Rule Nine anything above
medium is a no-ball. Fast bowling’s dangerous
here, you know, tempts one to hit so hard. Do
you hear that, Charlie?—nothing above medium.”</p>

<p>The best bowler in England was cruel enough
to drop in one of his celebrated “yorkers” to his
sister first ball. Even with the most accomplished
defensive batswomen a yorker is always
liable to have a fatal termination. It had in this
instance. Crash went Miss Grace’s middle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>“No-ball!” yelled the umpire, just in the nick
of time.</p>

<p>“Got that no-ball down to Gloucester, Father?”
cried the imperturbable Grace to her parent who sat
scoring under a willow tree, a safe distance away.
“Oh, and Biffin, I think I’d better have two leg,
I was bit inside that one, wasn’t I?” The way
in which she lifted a bail and scraped the crease
was W.G. to the manner born. “And, Toddles, <i>can’t</i>
you keep from dancing behind the bowler’s arm?”</p>

<p>If the best bowler in England thought he was going
to catch his sister napping a second time he was the
victim of a grievous error. His yorkers had no
terrors for her now. She got her bat down to
every individual one, and had the temerity to block
one so hard that she scored a single off it. She
played a watchful and not altogether unscientific
game, and despite the fact that three men were on
the onside watching the case on behalf of the
cucumber frame, she caused the bowling to be
changed four times, and stayed in fifty minutes
for sixteen. And the manner of her dismissal
was decidedly unlucky. The gallant Artilleryman
going on with his lobs as a last resource, his sister
was no longer able to restrain her ardent soul:
she got in a really fine straight in the manner
of her brother Archie, whereon running in hard
from the library windows, the little parson effected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
one of the finest catches ever witnessed on the
Rectory lawn.</p>

<p>Contrary to expectation the finish was desperately
close. Through my ignorance of the
ground I had the misfortune to be run out for a
duck. Toddles, who succeeded, shaped beautifully,
his wrist work and knife-like cutting being a
theme for general admiration. After contributing
three singles and a two, however, he lost his
wicket in a somewhat humiliating way. Grace,
fielding mid-off, had by no means forgiven him
for his wonderful catch, and was evidently, to
judge by her concentrated look, biding her time.
Presently, the little parson smashed one right at
her all along the carpet at a great pace. Mid-off’s
disturbed expression, and the quick way in which
she turned round apparently to pursue, clearly indicated
that she had been guilty of misfielding, and
had allowed the ball to pass her. The unsuspecting
Toddles started for a run, whereon the fieldsman
like a flash of light produced the missing
ball from the infinite recesses of her skirts, returned
it hard and true, and the wicket-keeper had
the little parson out by about two yards.</p>

<p>“I’ll teach you to refuse Halliday, and then
take me, when you wouldn’t a’ got to mine at all
if you hadn’t been such a quick-footed little brute,”
cried Mid-off in triumph.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>Although it was one of the most flagrant cases
of deception that either Middlesex or Gloucestershire
had ever seen practised, the unfortunate
Toddles had undoubtedly received his <i>quietus</i>.</p>

<p>“Just the sort o’ thing a girl would do,” said
T. S. M. “Beas’ly bad form, I call it.”</p>

<p>“Let this be a warning to you, Tommy,” said
Miss Grace, who actually seemed to be exulting in
her act. “As you’re so young, Kent’s certain to
try it on Monday. Toddles will, for one.”</p>

<p>“It’s worse than the Cambridge no-ball dodge,”
said Carteret, coming in last man to bat.</p>

<p>The finish proved exciting to a degree. Carteret
was a first-class bat in every way, who had a fine
eye, and came down very hard on the ball. Despite
the correctness of the fielding, and the fine length
that Charlie kept, Gloucestershire won by one
wicket.</p>

<p>As W. G. led the victorious eleven back to the
remains of the strawberries and cream, our representative
understood the Champion to remark:—</p>

<p>“I’ve said all along that this very toney, classy
Middlesex team had only got to be tackled fair for
the stitches to come undone, and the sawdust to
begin to trickle. Two lickings in succession’s
pretty thick, ain’t it, Stoddy? You two’ll stay to
dinner of course?”</p>

<p>“Charmed,” said I promptly. And then in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
judicious aside to George, “But what price togs?
Riding breeches and a flannel shirt, don’t you
know!”</p>

<p>“Don’t fag with dressing when we’re on our
own, do we boys,” said the consummate Grace, who
had an alertness that was as perfect as her frankness.
“The Guv’nor’s good as gold, especially in
summer. It’s only when the Bishop brings his
Mary, or there’s a bit of a slap-up dinner party on,
which I sometimes let the Guv’nor have if his
behaviour’s been very beautiful, well then, of
course, we have to buck up a bit, and try to
look pretty.”</p>

<p>“Ever so easy in your case,” said I.</p>

<p>Alas! it fell on perfectly deaf ears.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br>

In which I am more Sinned against than Sinning</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHILE eight men were scrubbing themselves
in the bath-room prior to the dinner bell,
their behaviour, as is only too usual when eight
men are trying to do the same thing at the same
time, was not too lady-like. Their talk also was
breezy and of a rather penetrating kind.</p>

<p>“If Brightside’s not here to-night with intent,”
said Elphinstone, in his slow, clerical sing-song, in
the middle of a free fight round a bath-towel, “you
can call me American. I’ve been looking at Brightside,
and I’m certain that he meditates making a
silly ass of himself.”</p>

<p>“Do you, Brightside?” I cried, with deep feeling.</p>

<p>“Oh, damn,” said the Optimist coarsely. But
his complexion was becoming a fine tawny.</p>

<p>“He’s going through with it to-night though, if
it kills him,” said the wicked little parson.</p>

<p>“More likely to kill her,” said Carteret.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>“Matter of opinion,” said the little parson: “but
one can’t help respecting Brightside. No earthly
and all that, he knows, but I’m certain that he’s
going to cause Grace to become a sister to him.”</p>

<p>“So there!” said Carteret.</p>

<p>“We call ’em the Bougheys, you know,” said the
wicked little parson, in a disgustingly confidential
tone, “in affectionate remembrance of that noble
idiot over the way. ’Comes here every fortnight
now to get Grace’s opinion as to what marl he
should put on his wickets in the winter, and whether
in her opinion grass seeds are superior to new
turf, or <i>vice versa</i>. She’s a sister to him, his step-sister,
his sister-in-law, his deceased wife’s sister,
his aunt, his grandmother, his niece, his cousin, his
second cousin; and our dear, delightful Grace now
spends her time in inventing new relationships, as
she’s quite used up the Prayer-book. Last time he
came she promised to be his Prussian cousin. I
don’t doubt that in the end she’ll be his murderess.
Isn’t it a pity that the English aristocracy has no
sense of humour? And from what that man Comfort
told me at lunch, I rather fear that Dimsdale
is also to have an attack of incipient dam silliness.”</p>

<p>“It’s coming; I can feel it,” said I, with brazen
effrontery. “Brown holland’s kept me awake all
night; and the encouraging part of it is, I feel as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
though I shall never sleep again until I’ve converted
myself into a form of common amusement.”</p>

<p>“Well, here’s my sympathy, old man,” said Charlie,
hurling a missile at me, which I mistakenly thought
was nothing more serious than a loofah. But the
moment it crashed against my cheek-bone I suddenly
arrived at the conclusion that there must be
a cake of brown Windsor carefully wrapped inside
it.</p>

<p>It is rather a pity that I don’t wield the pen of
Truthful James, considering what transpired when
I mistakenly attempted to discuss the matter with
the man who had thrown the soap. But as Charlie
had the brute force of a bullock, and didn’t know
his strength, in less than a minute I was very
sorry that I had chosen to grapple with him. Had
it not been that the Rev. Mr. Elphinstone, who
was really a most intrepid little man, used his
feet and elbows freely, at the crucial moment, on
the best bowler in England’s sacred person, I should
have been killed undoubtedly.</p>

<p>When the interested bystanders had repaired
these breaches of the peace by a liberal application
of cold water and hard epithets, the bell
summoned us to dinner. We were in no position
to obey it, however, until I had borrowed a
collar from Charlie to replace the one that he had
torn in two, and until my brave friend, the little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
parson, had changed his shirt, as the one that
now adorned him had been exceeding mutilated.
Charlie himself, who was as hard as steel, and
wiry as a mustang, was much as he was before
this lamentable affair, except that he was now
breathing through his mouth instead of through
his nose.</p>

<p>“There’s really no hurry, Toddles, you know,”
said Archie, while that ornament of the Church
sponged the blood from his teeth. “It’s only ten
minutes since the bell went, and if there’s one thing
the Guv does thoroughly enjoy, it is for a curate
to come between him and his dinner. And it
would make us all so sorrowful if you were to
forfeit his high opinion, for we all feel that you
will never be able to impose on anybody else.
Besides, you won’t be in time to say the grace,
you bloody little ruffian!”</p>

<p>Despite this prediction, however, the Rector continued
to be courtesy itself. No doubt this was his
habit, as he certainly possessed some magnetic
quality that caused his high-spirited family to
regard him with affectionate awe. Miss Grace,
herself the highest spirited of them all, might
be said to worship him. In the words of Archie,
“The Guv’nor might be the inventor of cricket,”
such was the estimation in which his daughter
held him. As for that adorable person, she was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
apparently as much at home in the dining-room as
in the tented field. She could play the hostess as
easily as she could play the game. She indicated
the course of the talk with a brisk tact that would
have commended itself to the professional hostesses
of Carlton House Terrace, and in her <i>décolleté</i> white
silk looked an angel, if a somewhat highly developed
one. Her bowling arm was particularly noticeable,
but that didn’t bother her a bit. It might be that
Miss Grace’s amiability enabled us to dispense with
our war-paint, but Miss Grace’s sex absolutely forbade
her to dispense with hers.</p>

<p>“Any of you men thought of the Sillenger yet?”
she began with the soup. “Fancy ‘Kensit’ myself
rather.”</p>

<p>“I’ve a leaning towards ‘Helbeck of Bannisdale,’”
said the little curate.</p>

<p>“Naturally,” Miss Grace said. “But he wasn’t
even placed in the Derby. You take my tip,
Toddles, he’s a rotter.”</p>

<p>“Laura,” said the Rector, “I am very sorry to
hear you employ such an amount of slang. In
my opinion it is a most offensive habit, particularly
in women.”</p>

<p>“Well, you see, Father,” said his ingenuous
daughter, “it’s a short way of saying a lot. Besides,
the boys use it.”</p>

<p>“Boys are barbarians,” said her parent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>“Oh, they are,” said Miss Grace. “Well, I
think barbarians aren’t half bad. Anyhow, I
like what they like, so I s’pose I’m a bit of a
barbarian too.”</p>

<p>“Jennings,” said Archie, “serve the claret cup,
quick! Grace, we’re going to drink your thundering
good health.”</p>

<p>We drank it with rare cordiality. The poor,
dear Optimist who was seated at my side had
such an agitated hand that a portion of the contents
of his glass overflowed upon the cloth.</p>

<p>“You’ve spilt your luck,” said Toddles, in a
melancholy undertone.</p>

<p>The Optimist’s condition was indeed to be deplored.
The meal was wholly excellent in its unpretentiousness;
yet here was this young man,
who knew what dining was, utterly unable to
appreciate his chance. The way in which he
toyed with and disdained fare that could meet the
needs of a parson with a palate was tragical
indeed. As for me, I was in a humour of sheer
devilry. Now I have no wish to bristle with wise
saws and modern instances, or even to be suspected
of an epigram, but it always seems to me that
when emotion overtakes him, a man is either an
ox or a giddy ox. I am the latter, and I think
when I come to be hanged that I shall go to the gallows
whistling. For such is the amount of coarse,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
brutal, downright British bull-dog that has gone
to the formation of my character, that I was able
to eat, drink, and let my soul flow at the festive
board, well knowing that those indescribably subtle
symptoms that had been born so recently within
me were growing more inconvenient hour by
hour. Looking at the glorious Miss Grace, and
the fine figure of a girl she made, and comparing
her to the two very, very average men who were
in imminent danger, if you will please pardon the
outworn image, of fluttering to their doom like
moths; comparing her, I say—oh, hang it, what
do I say? But there, Impatient Reader, you know
what makes my mind so mixed, and why it’s
muddling my prose. Or if you don’t, I think you
will know, one day, since there comes a moment
in the career of every average man—oh, what <i>am</i>
I saying?—really, Reader, I had no intention to
be rude!—when the sense of one’s own indescribability
is really so indescribable that one must feel
it before it can be felt—oh damn!</p>

<p>Reader, I am sure I beg your pardon. But
you understand me, don’t you? To-night I had
dwindled into the condition that I have so lucidly
described. Here was I, a mere cub, with only a
big appetite and the most animal health to recommend
me, looking down a dinner-table towards
the One Girl in the World. True, I had sound<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
lungs, a nice wrist for cutting, an eye as clear
as Grace’s own, and was mercifully free of the curse
of intellect in any form whatever; but surely even
such fine attributes as these are not too princely when
laid at the feet of the Goddess. No doubt Richard
Cranford Dimsdale was a pretty harmless sort of
fellow, but an astonishing quantity of harmlessness
goes to the making of a husband.</p>

<p>Above all, I knew these speculations to be cheek
of the worst kind; but if a horrid, impish little
clergyman sits opposite, and regards one with a
gaze of pure, rapturous pity, and talks in a holy
undertone of that man Comfort, and what that man
Comfort said, and what a privilege it is to converse
with a person of his polished manners and width of
outlook, it is not always possible for one to marshal
one’s meditations into the channels of decency.
As for the poor, dear Optimist, he suffered to a
like extent from the indefatigable Toddles. The
cheerful wretch writhed through the meal, and,
of course, the moment he tried to deliver a kick
under the table to Toddles, he fetched the Rector
a crack on the knee. But in the matter of our
peerless hostess, the Optimist and I effusively
agreed with one another that we were both equally
impossible. We were simply indulging in the dangerous
amusement of skating over thin ice just for
the pleasure of hearing it crack, and the cold water<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
gurgle under our feet. The Optimist has long been
regarded as a past master in the art of partaking
of unexpected joys. It is recorded of him that he
has been known to tip an umpire after being leg
before, and to make a pun on being run out.</p>

<p>Dessert over, Miss Grace withdrew. Immediately
afterwards the Rector retired to his den.</p>

<p>“What’s it to be—‘pills’ or poker?” said Charlie,
as the rest of us lingered over the coffee and
cigars.</p>

<p>“Brightside looks so quietly happy,” said Toddles
at last audible to all, “that to begin with, he might
minister to the enjoyment of life by standing on his
head, or otherwise making his ecstasy articulate.
He looks like one who has built a philosophy upon
his sorrow.”</p>

<p>Never, ere now, had I seen the Optimist positively
strain after cheerfulness. It was an impressive
sight. But is it not strange the vast difference
there is in the constitution of the most common
men? For I was indecently hilarious. I laughed
myself to tears over my own stories, unblushing
chestnuts as they were.</p>

<p>“For your information, Brightside,” said the
little parson, “Grace is a good girl, who goes to
bed at ten. It is now nine-twenty. Therefore if
you desire to compliment her to-night, you’ve got
to buck up!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>“Do you men take me for a common jay?”
said the Optimist. “Do you think I don’t know
exactly how big I bulge in this great universe?
Not for J. Brightside, thank you. If he were going
out with Stoddart, it might be otherwise; but his
batting’s really too steep!”</p>

<p>“Brightside,” said the persevering little parson,
“we’re deceived in you. We thought you were a
man with g—,—with an interior.”</p>

<p>“Sorry to disappoint you,” the Optimist said;
“but I recognise my limitations, thank you.
Don’t fancy myself a Ranjy quite.”</p>

<p>“But women are that funny,” said the little
parson, “one don’t know exactly how they’ll act.”</p>

<p>“You mayn’t,” said the Optimist. “I do. They
leave undone the things they ought to have done,
and do the things they ought not to have done.”</p>

<p>“Grace’ll accept you then!” said Carteret. He
had the air of a man who has found himself out
in saying a smart thing.</p>

<p>Impatient Reader, I am aware that this is very
impossible considered as talk, and very contemptible
considered as wit; but even county cricketers
can do no better in a dry season. The long spells
of fielding are too much, even for their magnificent
physiques. It must be admitted that in very wet
years, such as ’79 and ’88, when the bowlers
have made hay, they are occasionally heard to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
quote Mrs. Humphry Ward, Mr. Hall Caine, and
poor dear Mr. Shakespeare. At all other times
their quotations can be traced to the <i>Pink ’Un</i>.</p>

<p>Finding that there had been a “slump” in the
Optimist’s courage, the mischievous little parson
was good enough to honour me with some attention.</p>

<p>“My dear Dimsdale,” he purred, “we are hoping
that for the honour of Little Clumpton you’re
not going to funk.”</p>

<p>“Hickory’ll lay five to two he does,” said Carteret.</p>

<p>“Oh, if you are going to make it a sort of
international affair,” said I protestingly. But all
the same these cunning men were trapping me.
And to crown all, the one person I counted on to
lend me his aid, betrayed me basely and played
into the hands of the other side.</p>

<p>“My dear chap,” the benevolent Optimist said,
“I’ve known Grace from her earliest youth, but
I am perfectly willing to waive the priority of
my claim. Perfectly willing, as I cannot too
explicitly state. I recognise my limitations. But
you, my dear Dimsdale, are one of those big-gutted
Britons who runs this little earth, the sun, the
moon, and the planetary system for the private
amusement of himself and a few of his English
friends. You are of the fibre to go in and win.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>“Besides, we’ve all great confidence in Little
Clumpton in the ultimate,” said the complimentary
little parson; “and we know that when
Dimsdale gets his blood up he’s the doggedest
swashbuckler that ever said, ‘What ho!’”</p>

<p>The effusiveness of my aiders and abettors made
me squirm.</p>

<p>“You’ve got to do it now,” said the Optimist.
“Since the affair has become another Little Clumpton
<i>v.</i> Hickory, you must do something for your
side, you know, particularly as you were the
only single figure man yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Must try and get into the doubles, old chap,”
said the little parson coaxingly.</p>

<p>“Deuced pleasant outlook,” said I. “Shouldn’t
care if I’d played for the county once; but a
mere club-man—ugh!”</p>

<p>“She may be rather rude,” said Toddles. “Cool
cheek makes some girls stick their fur up. Or
she mayn’t, of course. Might let you down ever
so gently, as she’s had a lot of experience.”</p>

<p>“A word in your ear,” said the Optimist.
“Whatever you do, don’t play the goose game.
Hard slogging’s the sort o’ thing for Grace.
That’s where that owl, Boughey, always comes
such a cropper. Will spread himself so.”</p>

<p>“Boughey will lisp in numbers, you know,”
said Carteret. “Overflows with it, the idiot! and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
makes old Grace so riled that she chucks the
beautiful calf-bound poetry books he brings her
regularly at his head. I’ve seen Boughey come
out bleeding in other places than his heart.
Whatever you do, my gallant, give a wide berth
to the Bodlihead.”</p>

<p>“Your views are a great privilege, I’m sure,”
said I.</p>

<p>Truth to tell, the more I saw of their game,
the less I liked it. My sentiments, to which the
wretched Comfort had given such an unpleasant
publicity, were doubtless receiving this amount
of attention that the conspirators might score all
round. They were certainly scoring off me, and
the idea came into my head that they were scoring
off Miss Grace’s brothers also. For that quartette
smoked with a steady enjoyment that was
designed to show their complete indifference to
the topic under discussion. Judging by the excessive
disinterestedness of their mien, they were not
even aware of its delicate character.</p>

<p>“Devilish well-bred of you fellows to be so
full of <i>dolce far niente</i>,” said the unblushing
barrister. “Quite the right thing, of course; but
we do wish you’d be rather more keenly alive to
your responsibilities. Your knowledge of Grace’s
pretty little ways under fire might be simply invaluable
to Dimsdale. Simply <i>invaluable</i>. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
you know you would never forgive yourselves if
our ingenuous Dimsdale got badly mauled through
lacking that expert advice that you are so well
qualified to give him.”</p>

<p>“What’s the speech about, Jimmy?” asked
Archie. “Is it on Ritualism, or are you practising
the art of addressing the jury?”</p>

<p>“This intellectual obsession is sad,” said Toddles.
“Dimsdale has decided to propose to Grace, who
we have reason to believe is a connection of yours.
We are now forming ourselves into a committee
that has for its object the protection of Dimsdale.
The problem we are called upon to settle at this
stage is, whether it would be safer for him to
prosecute his addresses in a suit of mail, or is she
likely to be sufficiently overawed if he goes armed
with a six-shooter only. Archie, the committee
would be glad to have your views.”</p>

<p>“Dimsdale,” said that oracle, turning to me,
“I don’t know who’s put you up to this, but
whoever they are they’re not humane.”</p>

<p>“They ought to be kicked,” said George.</p>

<p>“He’s in a big enough funk already, without
you men doing your little bit,” said the Optimist.</p>

<p>Everybody, with one exception, was enjoying
the fun immensely. I was the exception. It is
not nice to be at the mercy of one’s intimates.
But now by some mysterious means I was delivered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
into their hands. One can scarcely expect
the average man to join in the laugh against
himself in such circumstances. They were so
delicate. Indeed, only rude coarse men would be
capable of creating them. And to a person of
sensibility, they were aggravated by the presence
of Grace’s arrogant male relations. Never a
doubt that they were arrogant. They, in common
with the conspirators, seemed quite unable to treat
me with respect. And at least I thought that that
justice should be granted to me, for a man who
has been awake all night feels entitled to some
little consideration.</p>

<p>“Sir Knight,” said the little parson, “I would
fain remind thee that ’tis now nine-forty by this
my good chronometer. Twenty minutes hence
the divinity retireth.”</p>

<p>This specific mention seemed to lend additional
flavour to their chaff. They were getting up my
blood. And when that is thoroughly aroused, I
enjoy the character of being a somewhat headstrong
person. Therefore when at a quarter to ten
I discarded my cigar, finished my coffee, and quietly
announced that I was going to face the music,
they ought not to have been as staggered as they
were.</p>

<p>“What now?” they shouted.</p>

<p>“<i>Oui, oui</i>,” said I, stepping to the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>“Look here,” said the alarmed Archie, “this
is beyond a joke.”</p>

<p>“By, by,” said I; “see you later.”</p>

<p>“Look here,” said Miss Grace’s military brother,
“no dam foolery, Dimsdale. Sit down and finish
your cigar. Toddles, if you don’t hold your
tongue I’ll choke you. This has gone too far.”</p>

<p>“I’ll lay a ‘pony’ that Dimsdale don’t do it,”
said Carteret.</p>

<p>“Done,” said I.</p>

<p>“You can call that ‘pony’ squandered, Jimmy,”
said the Optimist, with tears of gladness in his
eyes.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it gaudy?” said the little parson rapturously.
“Isn’t it ger-lor-i-ous?”</p>

<p>But even at this late hour I don’t think any of
them quite realized the finality of my resolve.
For when I got so far as to open the door, they
were one and all so thunderstruck that they could
not say a word. It was only when with an
assumption of bravado that I flippantly commended
myself to their prayers, and walked out of the
room, that they set up a positive howl of laughter.
I am not sure, though, whether it was not rather
hollow.</p>

<p>As for myself, I might have a dim consciousness
that my folly was colossal, yet this in no
wise deterred me. If I am at any time goaded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
into action, no matter how indefinite its nature,
it is no part of my character to stop halfway;
therefore it was in a devil-may-care, hands-in-the-pockets,
two-o’clock-in-the-morning fashion
that I sauntered into the library, incredibly impudent
of mien.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br>

Facing the Music</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MISS GRACE was seated at the table under
the lamp, and I was a trifle discomfited to
find that a very palpable frown was disfiguring
her mobile brow.</p>

<p>“Nineteen from forty-one, quick!” she cried,
without looking up. And as I answered, after
due thought, “Twenty-three, I mean twenty-four;
no, I mean twenty-two,” she lifted her head to
say,—</p>

<p>“Thanks so much”; and added, “Hullo! it’s you,
is it, Dimmy? Don’t mind me calling you Dimmy,
do you? Rather a nice easy, slipping kind of a
name is Dimmy, isn’t it, Dimmy? Besides, I
can’t always be saying Mr., can I? as though
I were a pro.”</p>

<p>“If you’ll allow me to call you Grace,” said I,
“that’ll be all right.”</p>

<p>“You can call me anything you just please,”
said she, “as long as it isn’t Laura. I hate
Laura.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>“I have known some very pretty Lauras,”
said I.</p>

<p>“Now look here, Dimmy,” said Miss Grace
fiercely, “how on earth can I bring the first-class
averages up to date if you keep talking? Stanley
Jackson’s in a frightful tangle as it is. If you
want a book, take it and cut, and close the door
quietly.”</p>

<p>“Sorry,” said I, “horribly sorry. But may I
help you?”</p>

<p>“Awfully glad if you would,” said she. “I
shall never get done to-night. Oh, hang it! the
wire from the Oval’s not here yet. Confound
’em!”</p>

<p>Approaching the table, I was now able to observe
what her occupation was. She was busily engaged
in deducing facts and figures from a litter
of telegrams, and transferring them to formidable
sheets of foolscap. My look was too perplexed
to be ignored.</p>

<p>“Rather a good idea,” she explained. “As we
can’t get an evening paper in these parts, anyhow,
we arrange for ‘the close of the day’s play’ to
be wired from the county grounds.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you wait for the morning papers?”
I asked.</p>

<p>“Morning papers, indeed!” said Miss Grace
witheringly. “How do you s’pose I’m going to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
get to sleep if I don’t know what the boys have
done? Why, Archie might have bagged a brace,
or Charlie might have got his hundred.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t think of that,” I said penitently. “But
surely it’s not absolutely necessary for you to work
out the averages every night, when by the payment
of the ridiculously inadequate sum of one
penny you can get trained journalists to do it for
you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I like to be knowing,” she said. “It’s not
absolutely necessary, of course, but I can’t rest
somehow till I’ve got the principal men reckoned
up to date. That little beggar Bobby Abel will
keep trying to get his nose in front of Archie,
and then Albert Ward and Gunn are always
treading on his heels. Then Tom Richardson and
Briggs are putting in all they know to knock
Charlie off his perch. It’s not all jam, I can tell
you, having brothers who are such tremendous
swells. All the world will keep looking at ’em,
and if one of ’em’s a bit below himself, out comes
the <i>Daily Chronicle</i> with a picture in five colours
of A. H. Trentham’s deplorable exhibition at Old
Trafford yesterday, and yarns of that sort. It
comes jolly hard on a girl, I can tell you, Dimmy,
if you’ve kept ’em on brine baths and a training diet
all the week, and then one of ’em goes and blots
his copy-book like that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>“From what I hear,” said I, “it’s nothing but
your diligence and motherly behaviour to ’em
that’s made ’em as famous as they are.”</p>

<p>“I don’t say that,” remarked the modest Grace,
but her expression said that this judicious statement
was not unpleasing. “But I deserve a little
bit of credit for their fame. The amount of watching
that they take is something awful; Charlie in
particular. At times Charlie’s just heart-breaking.
Sometimes I can’t sleep for thinking of him!”</p>

<p>Had the best bowler at either ’Varsity since
Sammy Woods been just then in my place and
heard his sister’s long-drawn sigh and seen her
pronounced tendency to tears, I’m certain that that
robust sinner would have gone down on his knees
before her and prayed for a remission of his sins.
I think I never was more touched.</p>

<p>“What a shame!” said I.</p>

<p>“He’s so careless,” she said; “can’t restrain
himself, you know; and he don’t feel his responsibilities
a bit. He don’t care a pin about his
average. ’Might be the ordinaryest bowler that
ever was, instead of Charlie Trentham. Bought
him a Whiteley exerciser for his birthday, but he
uses all his spare time in whistling and playing
‘pills,’ instead of getting up his muscle and his
stamina.”</p>

<p>“He must be a great trial,” said I, working the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
sympathetic vein for all that it was worth. I think,
though, the Great Trial would have had a fit had
he been privileged to hear me.</p>

<p>“Yes, Dimmy, that’s exactly what he is—he is
a trial,” said poor Miss Grace. “If he’d only got
a bit of head, I wouldn’t care. He’s got the courage
of a lion, never knows when he’s licked and all
that, and his muscles are just lovely; but as for
intellect, you’ve only got to treat him to a drink
to make him your friend for ever. And I don’t
think he knows what two and two make, either.
Here’s an instance now: he actually invites down
that wicked little Toddles, when he’s going to play
for Middlesex against Kent on Monday. And what
does that wicked little Toddles do? Like the giddy
goat I am, I didn’t sit up and see ’em all to bed, as
I mean to do to-night, but left ’em up with a promise
of ‘We shan’t be long.’ But weren’t they!
Well, I lay awake and listened for ’em, but never
heard a sound. When the clock struck two, I got
up and dressed, and came down to see what they
were up to. There were those three beautiful
brothers o’ mine, who are playing against Kent
on Monday, having a hand at poker with Jimmy
Carteret, whilst the Rev. Mr. Toddles, if you please,
was mixing their drinks. An owl would see the
Rev. Mr. Toddles’s little game. He means to have
Charlie as stale as anything by Monday, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
Archie’s liver wrong. But I told Master Curate
precisely what I thought about him, and gave him
the straight tip, too, that if he did manage to get
the boys crocked for Monday, he should have a
pretty thick dose of Keating’s vermin-killer in his
soup, the little insect! Yes,” she concluded, with
grim determination, “if I never get to bed at all,
I’ll see that there are no more larks like this to-night.
In my opinion, Dimmy, all men are blackguards!”</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear Grace!” I cried, with a face of
agony.</p>

<p>“No, old chap, I didn’t mean quite that,” she
said. “I’m so sorry. I hope I’ve not hurt you.”</p>

<p>Her penitence was charming.</p>

<p>Now I could see that she was much distressed in
mind in regard to the behaviour of her wayward
charges. She was longing for a little sympathy.
What a golden opportunity! How the Fates were
playing into my hands!</p>

<p>“My dear Grace,” said I, “you are much too
good to these ungrateful beggars.”</p>

<p>“They are not ungrateful, and they are not
beggars,” said their sister; “they’re awful good
sorts, every one of ’em, and don’t you dare to say
they’re not, Dimmy, or you and I’ll quarrel. It’s
Toddles who’s so bad.”</p>

<p>“Toddles is a little pig,” said I, feeling the repulse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
was terrible, and yet striving to retreat in
good order.</p>

<p>“Oh no, he’s not,” said Miss Grace; “that’s just
where you’re wrong. Toddles is a dear little chap.
I just love Toddles. It’s only his fun.”</p>

<p>“Just a girl all over!” I cried, my patience
ending in the masculine manner with a snap;
“just a girl. Say one thing and mean another;
contradict themselves ten times in as many ticks,
and then blame us for failing to understand ’em.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you get excited, Dimmy,” said Miss
Grace; “but get on with your work. Just check
those Brighton figures, will you? There, you’ve
gone and got Billy Murdoch down forty-seven
instead o’ forty-three; and you’ve missed Georgie
Brann out altogether.”</p>

<p>“I call that cool,” said I, “seeing that you copied
’em out yourself.”</p>

<p>“Well, didn’t I tell you to check ’em?” said she.
“Now look here, Dimmy, either drop your rotting,
and buckle to, or just clear out and leave me on
my own.”</p>

<p>“I <i>will</i> be good,” said I meekly.</p>

<p>But really my position was ludicrous. I had
been with her twenty minutes already, yet my high
purpose had not been even broached. I had missed
several chances. I felt my brazenness to be subsiding.
If I didn’t make a start at once, I should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
get into a funk, and smirch the name of Little
Clumpton and become the common mock of
Hickory. Yet how could I begin? Any little
bravado I might have had at the start was already
slain by the sense of the egregious errors I
had committed. The only course open was to fall
back on my nationality. Was it not lucky that
I prided myself on my Anglo-Saxon fibre and
directness? Let me say what I meant exactly.
Hard slogging, and not the goose game, as became
a Briton, don’t you know.</p>

<p>“Now then, Dimmy,” said Miss Grace, “the
Bristol figures are not on the ceiling; they’re on
the table. Just call ’em out while I dot ’em down.
Go on.”</p>

<p>“Grace, senior,” I read, “not out, one hundred
and sixty-eight. Oh, and that reminds me, Grace,
that I’ve got something serious to say.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” said she; “but you look what
you’re doing, or I shall have something serious to
say as well.”</p>

<p>“Grace,” said I, standing up, “I’ve got something
extremely serious to say.”</p>

<p>That young person put her pencil down so gently
that the restraint she used was noticeable. The
light in her eye made me quiver.</p>

<p>“Grace,” said I, and came to a sudden stop.
Yes, sitting down was decidedly better. It didn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
seem so formal, and your legs didn’t feel so
wobbly. I sat down accordingly. “Grace,” said
I once more; and then my throat went wrong, and
I had to pause and cough.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Grace meekly, “I s’pose my name’s
Grace. Go on, Dimmy; it’s ever so interesting.
But if it’s a joke, Dimmy, it’s not at all obvious.
Just read those Bristol figures out, there’s a good
chap.”</p>

<p>I picked up the telegram again, and called out
solemnly,—</p>

<p>“R. C. Dimsdale, bowled Grace, none.”</p>

<p>Miss Grace’s steady gaze went through me, then
came back and went through me again.</p>

<p>“Look here, Dimmy,” she said, with a deliberation
that was both incisive and well weighed, “I’m
not going to be ragged like this by you or anybody
else. Give me that wire, and now you just cut.
When I <i>want</i> to be bored, I read <i>Punch</i>.”</p>

<p>It was evident by the rigidity of her countenance
that she saw not the remotest connection between
what I had said and the terribly great matter that
was overbalancing my mind.</p>

<p>“I must explain,” said I doggedly.</p>

<p>“I don’t think you will,” said she gravely; “that
thing with a handle to it, Dimmy, is called a
door. If you open it, you will see the way out the
other side.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>“Thanks so much,” said I; “but then, you see,
I’m not going. I’ve got so much to say, Grace,
that really——”</p>

<p>“My dear Dimmy,” she interrupted, “if you
would only tell me where it hurts you, I might give
you a pick-me-up or something to set you straight.”</p>

<p>“It is in your power,” said I.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” said Grace cheerfully; “now
let’s have it. If it’s a cold, it’s compo; if it’s sleeplessness,
it’s potassium bromide; if it’s nerves, it’s
rest; if it’s a strain, it’s Elliman.”</p>

<p>“It’s a strain,” said I.</p>

<p>“Good old strain!” said Grace. “Thought it
must be a strain.”</p>

<p>“Of the heart!” said I.</p>

<p>“Next, please,” said Grace. “Whoever heard of
a chap straining his heart? Why, Charlie, who
lams ’em down like anything, has never strained
his heart.”</p>

<p>“He has not my delicate organization, you see,”
said I. “He’s as strong as a bullock, and just
about as susceptible. I, my dear Grace, am much
more delicately constituted. In fact, my dear
Grace, in fact——” Emotion drowned, however,
what was to have been a nicely rounded
period.</p>

<p>Miss Grace sighed, set down her pencil for the
second time, propped her chin on her hands, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
said with almost tearful resignation, “What <i>are</i>
you saying, Dimmy?”</p>

<p>I rose to my feet, for, after all, that was the
better way, as in a sitting posture one was unable
to obtain the fierce energy that this miserable
business undoubtedly demanded. Therefore,
springing to my feet, I said,—</p>

<p>“I mean just this, Grace. You’ve gone and
bowled me neck and heels.”</p>

<p>“Why, you said just now,” said she, “that you
had strained your heart.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said I, eagerly but crudely, “my heart’s
strained as well. And you’ve gone and clean
bowled me. Now put two and two together,
Grace. Surely you must see what I mean.”</p>

<p>“No, I’ll go to Klondyke if I do,” said Grace,
in despair. “Your heart strained—clean bowled.
No, I’ll go to Klondyke if I do! Is it a riddle?”</p>

<p>“A riddle,” said I, much hurt. “Oh, my dear
Grace, if you only knew how serious I am! I’ll
own that I’m not expressing myself very clearly.
Hang it! a fellow’s not used to this sort o’ thing.
I know I’m a blithering ass, you know. Oh,
Grace, dash it all! you must see what I mean!”</p>

<p>“Blithering ass!” murmured Grace, as if to
herself. “You <i>are</i> getting a bit more enlightening,
Dimmy.”</p>

<p>“No, no,” I said hastily; “you’re on the wrong<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
tack. That’s not what I want you to see. You
know! you know!”</p>

<p>“Dimmy,” said Grace, with her marvellous blue
eyes getting wider, “I shall be downright annoyed
with you in a minute. You say I know
when I don’t know; and when I do know, you say
that I don’t know. If this is a rag, Dimmy, it’s
very wicked of you, ’cause my time’s occupied.
These jolly averages’ll never get done to-night.
Do be a good boy and go. There, I’ve put the
Old Man down wrong! Dimmy, I shall be most
horribly angry in a minute.”</p>

<p>“Oh, drop this bally cricket!” I cried. “Do try
to think of serious things a little, Grace; do try to
think of what <i>I’m</i> saying. I do wish you’d attend
to what a fellow’s saying, and help him out a
bit.”</p>

<p>“I’d help you out with great pleasure, Dimmy,
very great pleasure, I can assure you, Dimmy,”
she said, “if I’d only got a boot like Charlie’s.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Grace!” I cried, “how obtuse you are!”</p>

<p>“That’s it, call me names,” said she.</p>

<p>Here a dreadfully painful silence came. It was
only disturbed by the aggressive behaviour of
my heart and the scratching of Miss Grace’s
pencil. Never in my life had I felt such an unmitigated
ruffian, and certainly never a more
uncompromising idiot. Doesn’t it seem absurd,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
considering the amount of totally unnecessary
things one learns at school—Latin, Greek, and so
forth—that the gentlemen of England are utterly
untrained in one of the most complex and delicate
sciences that ever has to be practised by the
human male? Oh, for a few of the most rudimentary
hints as to how to conduct a proposal!
Lord! what <i>is</i> a fellow to do when the object of
his passion is busily occupied with the preparation
of cricket averages, and not paying the least attention
to his distraught manner, or the gentle
hints conveyed in his conversation?</p>

<p>There was the wretched Grace, apparently overjoyed
at this lull in the proceedings, jotting down
figures with a haste that can only be described as
feverish, tossing telegrams about and looking really
dangerous to talk to. Very encouraging state of
affairs, considering that the sum total of my eloquence
was spent already. But the Briton in me,
after a two minutes’ interval, set doggedly to work
once more.</p>

<p>“Grace,” I re-opened, “I’m not a county man
an’ all that, you know. I’m not a Stoddy or a
Ranjy, you know. Not a W. G., you know. I’m
not a Toddles or an Archie, you know. You know
that, Grace, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, rats!” said Grace, figuring away more
feverishly than ever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>“Ah, but it’s not rats,” said I. “It’s not rats
at all. It’s far too serious for rats, I can assure
you, Grace. It’s something <i>very</i> serious, Grace.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” said Grace, with supreme indifference;
and then, biting her pencil and puckering
up her brow, she said: “How many times does
fourteen go into ninety-seven? Quick!”</p>

<p>“I’m not a ready-reckoner,” said I indignantly.</p>

<p>“You are a jolly rotter, Dimmy, that’s what you
are,” said Grace urbanely.</p>

<p>“Thanks,” said I; “how nice!” Then, having
felt the spur a bit, I took a headlong plunge almost
before I knew what I was about. “Grace,”
said I, “will you be my wife?”</p>

<p>“I’ll be your anything,” said Grace, without
looking up, and continuing her pencilling, “if
you’ll just have the goodness to clear out and pull
the door to gently. O-oh, I say! The Old Man’s
average is forty-three now. He’s gone up nine
places. He’s in front of Ranjy.”</p>

<p>I beat my boots on the carpet incontinently. If
this was the usual style of a girl when a man
pays her the highest compliment within his power,
God help all of us, say I.</p>

<p>“Grace,” said I weakly, “I hope you’re listening.”</p>

<p>“Hullo!” said Grace, searching frantically<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
among her mass of telegrams, “they haven’t sent
the Taunton yet. And where’s the jolly old Oval
got to? It’s always late. They’re dreadfully
slack to-night, though. Half a mind to write to
Lord Salisbury about it.”</p>

<p>“Grace,” said I, more weakly than before, “I
don’t believe you <i>are</i> listening. I—I—I’m asking
you to be my—my wife.”</p>

<p>I beg to be excused the poverty of my diction,
but really if I had not spoken in the most unsophisticated
fashion, I was rapidly getting into
such a state of nerves that I do not think I should
have spoken ever.</p>

<p>“Grace,” I said again, as she had paid no heed,
and this time thumping on the table with my hand,
that her polite attention might be attracted somehow.
“My wife—you—my wife—I want you to
be my wife—see!”</p>

<p>“Thanks awf’ly,” said Grace. “Awf’ly good—marvellously
good. Dimmy, what a clever chap
you are! Just let me set John Dixon straight,
and then I’ll laugh. Positive I’ll laugh.”</p>

<p>“Hang John Dixon!”</p>

<p>“We shall do nothing of the kind,” said Grace.
“He’s one o’ the best, is Johnny.”</p>

<p>“Grace,” I said abjectly, “I—I’m proposing to
you—want you to be my wife, you know. Most
awf’ly obliged if you will, you know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>“All right, Dimmy; half a mo’. I’m certain
that I’ll laugh. Thirteen from thirty leaves sixteen,
don’t it?”</p>

<p>Her pencil continued in its scratching at a most
outrageous rate.</p>

<p>“Pononner,” I repeated, “if you’ll have me,
Grace, pononner I shall be most awf’ly, beastly
obliged, don’t you know!”</p>

<p>It was dreadfully hard luck that at this moment,
just when I had lashed myself into a perfervid
and poetic heat, and a note of true passion had
accordingly come into my tone, that the library
door was seen to come open suddenly, if stealthily,
and a magnificent being appeared, bearing a salver
with more telegrams thereon.</p>

<p>“What, three!” cried Grace excitedly. “One’s
from the Oval, the other’s Taunton; but what’s
the third? Only expecting two. How funny! Yet
they’re all addressed ‘Trentham, Hickory’ right
enough. Did he say what made him so late,
Augustus? Was he <i>very</i> drunk?”</p>

<p>“Hextrahordinary hintoxicated, Miss,” said
Augustus, retiring with a sniff.</p>

<p>How cruel were the Fates! Here was I just
playing myself in, getting nicely set, as it were,
and beginning to feel at home, when the arrival
of these beastly telegrams simply banished me
and my remarks from Grace’s mind. And this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
was the more annoying since I had spent fifty
minutes in battering her into listening to what I
had to say.</p>

<p>“Surrey 401 for 6,” Grace was saying, as she
tore out the contents of the first. “Warwickshire’s
getting beans, as usual. Hooray! Bobby
Abel, run out, 17. That’s a scotch in his wheel!
It’ll drop him three places. Brockwell, 109. Tom
Hayward, 82. Jephson, 54. Key, not out, 100
exactly. Good of you, Kingsmill! Awf’ly pleased!
Do you heaps of good!”</p>

<p>I was biting my lips in the meantime and saying,
“My dear Grace,” at intervals, in so thin a
voice that it went entirely unheeded. The unhappy
thing was my conscientiousness. For I felt
that I should not be justified in calling my pitiful
efforts a veritable proposal, since Grace had persisted
in regarding them as nothing more consequent
than a feeble joke in rather questionable taste. But,
cost what it might, I was going to see the matter
through, having once embarked upon it.</p>

<p>“Hampshire, 203 all out,” Grace continued.
“Somerset, 115 for 5. Wicket must be fiery; yet
it shouldn’t be. Wonder if they’ve watered it?
Something’s up. Shouldn’t get out like that ’gainst
that sort o’ bowling. Wynyard, 70. Oh, and
Vernon Hill 42, not out. Tyler, 6 wickets for 90.
They’ve been watering the wicket, that’s what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
they’ve been doing. And now for the third.
Hanged if I can tell where it’s from. All the
cricket’s come. I’ll open it, though, as my name’s
Trentham.”</p>

<p>“It might be for somebody else, as there’s one
or two other people called Trentham in addition
to yourself,” said I, trying to introduce a word by
hook or by crook, and being also in that perverted
condition of mind when a man longs to say something
with a bit of a sting in it.</p>

<p>“Really!” said she. “How clever of you to
have thought of that, Dimmy! But as ‘Trentham,
Hickory’s’ me as much as anybody else, here
goes!”</p>

<p>Now as the contents of this telegram had so
dire an effect on the industrious Miss Grace, and
the results of it were so far-reaching, I think it
only right that it should have a chapter all to
itself.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI<br>

A Telegram from Stoddart</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE third telegram ran to this tenour,—</p>

<p>“If Hawke wants you for India, sing slow.
You are going with me. Stoddart.”</p>

<p>Miss Grace had a mounting colour as she read
this, and I believe swimming eyes and a reeling
brain. I think she would have liked to weep for
joy.</p>

<p>“Oh, Dimmy,” she said, “isn’t it divine! Isn’t
it <i>noble</i> of old Stoddy! But I knew it, I knew it
all along. It would have been impossible not to
take old Charlie. Wonder what the boys’ll
say?”</p>

<p>At last it seemed that something of sufficient
importance had occurred to tear her mind from
her all-absorbing occupation. She got up, her
cheeks still flushed, and moved to the door with a
sort of look on her face that implied that for the
present she was performing the extremely difficult
feat of walking on air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>But I was too quick for her. With a bound I
got to the door, and had my back snugly against
it by the time she arrived.</p>

<p>“Now then, Dimmy, get out of the way,” she
imperiously said. “Can’t wait a moment, you
know. Must tell the boys. They’ll just go mad.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you can’t,” said I immovably. “Really.
How nice! And you <i>must</i> tell the boys?”</p>

<p>“No more ragging, Dimmy,” said she. “Honour
bright, I can’t hold myself till I’ve told ’em.
What are you standing there like that for? I
want to pass.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you do,” said I. “How interesting! Awf’ly
glad you’ve told me. Jolly glad to know,
you know.”</p>

<p>“Dimmy, if you don’t drop your jolly jaw, and
let me pass, I’ll be downright angry. Do you
hear, Dimmy. Don’t play the Angora.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s like this,” said I. “For the last hour
you have been spending your time in deliberately
disregarding every word I’ve said. But now, my
dear Grace, pointedly speaking, you’ve bally well
got to listen, and the sooner you make your mind
up to it, the sooner you’ll get it over.”</p>

<p>At this Miss Grace began to flare up like anything.</p>

<p>“The music’ll play in a minute,” she said.
“Tell you straight, Dimmy, I’m a terror when I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
get my turkey up. If I do get my wool off, the
feathers’ll fly.”</p>

<p>“Nineteen from forty-one, quick!” said I. “But,
my dear Grace, you sit down and listen. That’s
my tip. It’s the only way you’ll get out just yet,
anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Don’t say I haven’t given you fair warning,
Dimmy, will you?” she cried, with her face in a
blaze.</p>

<p>“All right,” said I cheerily; “just give me time,
Grace, and I’ll laugh, I’m positive I’ll laugh.”</p>

<p>Grace stamped her foot. She looked things.</p>

<p>“Very nice, indeed,” said I. “I’m certain I’ll
laugh.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it <i>is</i> too bad!” she wailed. “Dimmy, you
<i>are</i> a brute! I <i>must</i> go and tell ’em. I must
really. Dimmy, <i>do</i> come away from that door,
there’s a good soul!”</p>

<p>“No,” said I callously; “not until you have
considered and replied to my proposal.”</p>

<p>“Proposal!” cried Grace, midway between
amazement and rage. “What proposal?”</p>

<p>“That comes of not listening,” said I. “Think
what you’ve missed. Am I to understand that
you didn’t hear a word I said?”</p>

<p>“That’s about it,” said Grace.</p>

<p>“Then, my dear Grace,” said I; “you take a
chair and listen. If I keep you here till two, I’m<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
going over it again, and I’m going to make you
listen.”</p>

<p>“Oh, are you?” Had Grace been any one but
Grace, I should have said she positively snorted.
“Oh, are you, Dimmy? Don’t you be too jolly
sure about it.”</p>

<p>I grieve to state that my ultimatum in Grace’s
opinion constituted a <i>casus belli</i>. The flying
squadron immediately received orders to sail, the
blood darted all over her face in the most pictorial
manner, and she picked one of the books of the
Rector’s off the table. She began to skirmish
a bit, making several feints, and awaiting her
opportunity.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to, Dimmy, you know,” said she.</p>

<p>“But by Jingo if you do, Grace,” said I.</p>

<p>“You’d better come out of it, Dimmy, you
know,” said this armed belligerent, trying to show
that our relations were not yet so strained but that
a conciliatory tone might preserve the peace, even
at this late hour. “It’s not a bit funny, you know.
It wasn’t exactly what one ’ud call a good joke
at the start, and now it’s getting as stale as
anything.”</p>

<p>“If it <i>is</i> a joke,” I quoted, “it’s not at all
obvious. When I <i>want</i> to be bored I read <i>Punch</i>.”</p>

<p>Crash came <i>Pearson on the Creed</i> full at my
head. I dodged, of course, but the momentum<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
of that weighty theological work as it hurtled
against the resisting oak panel of the library
door was really ominous. The noise appeared to
shake the foundations of the house.</p>

<p>“I’m glad,” said I, “that my nerves are fitted
with rubber tyres and ball bearings.”</p>

<p>It was some relief to see that the countenance
of the enemy had now changed to one of rue.
<i>Pearson on the Creed</i>, lay <i>sans</i> covers and practically
disembowelled at my feet. Poor Grace
flopped on her knees and began to gather the
mutilated members of this old but highly respectable
tome.</p>

<p>“Dimmy, you’re a brute! a beast! that’s what
you are!” she cried. “Do you see what <i>you</i>’ve
done? Oh, father will be angry! Oh, he will
talk! He will be eloquent! He’ll be ever such
a lot worse than he is on Sundays.”</p>

<p>His daughter, still on her knees, looked the picture
of despair.</p>

<p>“Will he be cursive?” I amiably inquired.</p>

<p>“No,” said the miserable Grace, vainly trying
to readjust the fragments. “He don’t take on like
that. Wish he did; then it wouldn’t be so rough.
When he has you on the carpet, he chucks a lot
of high dictionary language at you, like he does in
his sermons—awful big words, you know; what you
can’t understand, you know. And they <i>must</i> mean<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
a dreadful lot more than those you can, mustn’t
they? Oh, he’s just horribly, awfully polite. Last
time he told me ‘to restrain my primeval instincts.’
That’s a nice thing to say, isn’t it? Does he mean
don’t play the goat, or what? Shouldn’t mind if
I only knew what he meant.”</p>

<p>“He means don’t play the Angora,” said the
luminous I, with an air of knowledge.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s it, is it,” said Grace; “then why
don’t he jolly well say so, then, instead of rolling
up ‘primeval instincts’ to you and that kind o’
lingo?”</p>

<p>Grace having by this tenderly gathered <i>Pearson
on the Creed</i>, and having cunningly contrived
to restore him to some semblance of his former
unimpeachable respectability, rose from her knees,
and returned to the attack.</p>

<p>“Dimmy, do come from that door, there’s a nice
old chap,” she said. “I’ll be <i>so</i> good. I’m sure I’ll
listen to you when I’ve told the boys. I’m simply
dying to tell ’em. Dimmy, you brute! come from
that door at once!”</p>

<p>“Sit down,” said I, stretching my finger out in
my laconic sternness.</p>

<p>“If you don’t,” said she, “I’ll get <i>Hengstenberg’s
Dissertations on the Genuineness and Authenticity
of the Pentateuch</i> to you. That’ll make
you howl if it hits you, I’ll give you <i>my</i> word.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
And it don’t matter if we do knock the stuffing out
o’ that, ’cause it isn’t orthodox, you know.”</p>

<p>“Why, a girl couldn’t even lift a name like
that?” said I, to encourage her.</p>

<p>“Oh, you don’t draw me,” said the experienced
Grace. She had served an apprenticeship with
four brothers. However, I was glad to find that
the unhappy and distraught Grace had by this
arrived at the conclusion that there was only one
course open to her, if she was to be enabled to
convey the burning news to the dining-room in a
reasonable time. That one course was complete
submission. Accordingly, after a terrible struggle,
in which the native Eve, or perhaps the primeval
instincts, within her were persuaded to lie down,
she retired a few paces, leant against the table,
sighed heart-rendingly, and then laid her mutinously
twitching hands down by her sides as
placidly as possible.</p>

<p>“Fire away,” she said dismally; “I’ll listen.”</p>

<p>“Thanks awf’ly,” said I; “so good of you to
listen.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but, Dimmy, you great beast!” she implored,
“please do look nippy; I’m simply dying.”</p>

<p>“Well, what I’ve got to say’s just this,” said
I, and the courage I found wherewith to utter it
came partly, I suppose, from the excitement of my
late employments, and partly from the get-there-sometime<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span> 
Anglo-Saxon spirit that makes us all
feel such wonderful fine fellows. “Grace, I want
you to be my wife,” said I.</p>

<p>“Oh, if that’s all your nodding, and winking,
and reddening, and stuttering’s been about,” said
Grace, with evident relief, “I’ll be your anything,
so long as you’ll let me go immediately.”</p>

<p>“You misunderstand me rather,” said I, nearing
desperation. “’Pon my honour as a gentleman,
I want you to be my wife.”</p>

<p>“But the boys wouldn’t let me,” she said.</p>

<p>“The boys!” I cried. “What the devil—no, I
mean what the dickens have the boys got to do
with it? Who are the boys, pray? Never heard
of such a thing in my life.”</p>

<p>“Well, you see, Dimmy, it’s like this, you see,”
said Grace confidentially, but with her eye for
ever wandering to the door. “Nothing under a
county man’s their motto.”</p>

<p>“You mean it’s yours,” said I indignantly.</p>

<p>“Oh, I daresay,” said she. “If I’ve got to have
somebody, I’ll have a county man or nobody.”</p>

<p>“You’d have the Right Honourable Arthur
James Balfour, M.P.,” said I, to illustrate how
monstrously untenable was the position she had
taken up. “There’s never a girl that wouldn’t,
if I know anything.”</p>

<p>“Balfour, Balfour,” said Grace. “Balfour. Oh,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
yes, you mean the golf Johnny. Golf! What
next? Look here, Dimmy, do you take me for
a muff? Why, I wouldn’t marry Willie Park.”</p>

<p>“No,” said I; “because you’re going to marry
me.”</p>

<p>“Nothing under a county cricketer,” said she,
with an air of finality. “Besides, the boys ’ud be
just awful. Now then, Dimmy, out o’ the way.
I’ve heard you out all fair and square, haven’t
I?”</p>

<p>“Not by a lot,” said I. “My dear Grace, if
you don’t be reasonable, I shall have to declaim.
Don’t want to, I can assure you, but as a last
resort I shall certainly be obliged to lift up my
voice.”</p>

<p>“Angels and ministers of grace!” cried the
unhappy young person of that name; “I’ve let you
down ever so gently, and this is what I get for
it. You’re ungrateful, Dimmy, that’s what you
are! Now then, let me pass.”</p>

<p>“I’m not a county cricketer,” I began.</p>

<p>“It’s no secret,” said Grace.</p>

<p>“But I mean to be,” said I. “May get a trial
for the county this year. And didn’t you say
yourself that my crack to cover was all serene?”</p>

<p>These particular reminiscences of my batting
promised to modify Grace’s point of view.</p>

<p>“I’d clean forgotten your crack to cover,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
she, with a fallen look. “Hope I’ve not said
anything very rude, Dimmy. If I have, I’m
awf’ly humble.”</p>

<p>“You’ve been pretty thick,” said I, following
up what looked like an advantage. “And you
said my forward stroke was not so dusty, didn’t
you?”</p>

<p>“Very decent, indeed,” said the keen critic.
“Honour bright, Dimmy, I wasn’t really <i>very</i>
rude, was I?”</p>

<p>“Depends what you call rude,” said I. “You
see, there’s no standard measure of rudeness in
this country. You threw books and things at me,
but that’s a detail.”</p>

<p>“So I did,” she said sadly. “But I’d clean
forgot your crack to cover. Makes me feel rather
sick, Dimmy, when I think what I may have said.
You ought to have reminded me. One can’t think
of everything; ’specially as you’re quite an ordinary
looking sort o’ chap.”</p>

<p>“There you go again,” said I.</p>

<p>“That’s not what I meant <i>exactly</i>,” said this
frank young person. “What I mean is, you’re
not six four, and chest according. But, Dimmy,
<i>are</i> you going to let me pass?”</p>

<p>“Not till I’ve had something definite,” said I.</p>

<p>“You’ve got it,” said she.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear no,” said I. “You say nothing under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
a county cricketer. Well, as I’m certain to be
a county cricketer, your reply’s inadequate.”</p>

<p>“I like the certain,” said Grace. “I should go
‘Abundance’ on the certain.”</p>

<p>“The certain’s assumed for the sake of argument,”
said I.</p>

<p>“Dimmy, <i>will</i> you let me pass—<i>please</i>!”</p>

<p>“Will you give me some hope?” said I.</p>

<p>“Let me pass first,” said Grace, “then we’ll
talk about it.”</p>

<p>“You don’t come over me like that,” said I.
“Must have something definite. If I made myself
into a county man, would you give me a
show?”</p>

<p>“Oh, anything, anything,” said Grace, “so long
as you’ll let me pass!”</p>

<p>“Of course, I’ve not much to offer you, you
know,” said I, reduced to the coarse expedient.
“Only that crack to cover, you know, and a pretty
decent forward stroke. And, Grace, I’m developing
ever such a prime late cut, and I’ve great
hopes of my leg glance. When I get my eye
in and the pace o’ the ground, I can turn length
balls off my leg and middle.”</p>

<p>It gladdened me to think that she was softening
visibly.</p>

<p>“I should like to see all these fine things for
myself,” said she. “Must confess I haven’t seen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
’em yet. I’ll come and watch you play these
strokes against a bit of class bowling.”</p>

<p>All at once an idea hit me in the middle of the
waistcoat.</p>

<p>“Grace,” said I breathlessly, palpitatingly,
“s’pose you play me to-morrow under Rectory
rules on the lawn at single wicket. Then you
can test my cricket yourself, don’t you know.
What awful good fun! Isn’t that a big idea?”</p>

<p>“Dimmy, if you <i>don’t</i> let me go, I’m certain
that I shall be obliged to be rude,” said Grace,
still reining herself in nobly.</p>

<p>“You’d see me at work against a bit o’ class
bowling, you know,” said I.</p>

<p>“S’pose I should,” she said, pondering.</p>

<p>“And we might arrange it like this,” said I,
“just to lend a little interest to the thing. If
you beat me at single wicket on the Rectory
lawn to-morrow, I’m plucked, wiped out, clean
done. On the other hand, if I beat you, you
undertake to give my claims very serious consideration.”</p>

<p>“Oh, anything, anything,” said Grace, “if you’ll
just let me go. Dimmy, I’m certain that if I
didn’t know otherwise, I should think you were
a Harrow boy, your behaviour’s that abominably
crude. Oh, I <i>am</i> in a wax!”</p>

<p>“Look here, Grace,” said I, “I merely require<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
your promise that you’ll play me to-morrow on
these conditions, and then you are at liberty to
go.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got my promise,” said she, with an
off-hand haste that was by no means reassuring.</p>

<p>Thereupon I opened the door for the hot, angry,
and impatient Grace, and she slipped past me in
a flash, fearing no doubt that I should repent, and
close the door once more upon her.</p>

<p>“Dimmy,” said she, as we repaired together to
the boys, “I shall give you a most awful licking
to-morrow, you know. By Jove, Dimmy, I
wouldn’t be in your shoes! I <i>will</i> give you beans;
I <i>will</i> take it out of you for this.”</p>

<p>“<i>Per</i>-haps,” said I saucily. “But, Grace, I shall
go all the time, I can promise you. I mayn’t be
a county man, but I’m not in the habit of
letting girls walk over me with impunity.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I daresay,” said Grace cuttingly. “I
should judge that girls are just about your weight.
If you played your best, you might play very well
indeed against girls. But there’s one thing,
Dimmy, that I happen to know of your cricket.
<i>You can’t bowl for nuts.</i> And I <i>can</i> let daylight
into downright rubbish. Why, Toddles is actually
better than you at bowling, and I hit him most
horribly. Toddles funks me now. Oh, I shall
enjoy myself to-morrow. I’ll pay you out for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
to-night’s disgusting behaviour. If I can’t knock
the cover off your stuff, Dimmy, I’ll never touch
a bat again, so there!”</p>

<p>Alas! that my miserable bowling should deserve
every word she said about it. My heart sank.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br>

A Few of its Consequences</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">I &#160;REGRET to state that when Grace and I
came to “the boys” in the dining-room, we
discovered seven gentlemen seated round the
dining-room table, engaged in a game called
baccarat. It was reassuring to find, however,
that they were playing for nominal stakes, and
that it was being conducted under evident difficulties.</p>

<p>“Didn’t father say he positively wouldn’t have
it!” cried Miss Grace. “Oh, there will be a
row if he catches you at it. Do drop it, there’s
good men.”</p>

<p>“He’ll put up with anything to-night,” said
Toddles brazenly, “now that Tom’s got a trial
with the county.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you a piece of prime news, if you’ll
just drop it, boys,” said Grace coaxingly. But
the amount of restraint she practised to hold
back the prime news in question must have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
wonderful. I suppose it is that women have such
remarkable powers of diplomacy.</p>

<p>“Has that demoralising little Ranjy got another
two hundred?” cried Number Three in the batting
averages apprehensively. “Because if he has,
I shall just chuck up the sponge; I can’t hope
to catch him.”</p>

<p>“Better than that, Archie,” said his sister darkly,
“<i>ever</i> so much better than that. <i>Can’t</i> you
guess?”</p>

<p>Grace, on her own part, however, spared him the
trouble. She was no longer able to suppress her
eagerness. Impulsively straightening the telegram
that was crushed in her hands she read out its
contents at the top of a victorious voice.</p>

<p>Baccarat was forgotten. Led by Grace herself,
the company gave three rousing cheers for
Stoddart, then another three for Charlie. Then,
on the suggestion of the Rev. Mr. Elphinstone,
another three for the bearer of the news, which
was, of course, Miss Grace. Then, on the suggestion
of Miss Grace, there were three for the
Rev. Mr. Elphinstone, though why nobody knew
exactly; and in the end everybody was cheering
everybody else, and generally kicking up the
most horrible noise it was possible to make. The
redoubtable Toddles, who scaled a little over nine
stones himself, was endeavouring to carry fourteen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
stones ten pounds, in the person of Charlie,
round the room by his own force of character,
when the Rector appeared from his study with a
look not all pleasure upon his face.</p>

<p>“If you would like the hose,” said he, “I think
you’ll find it in the garden.” His daughter cut
his observations short, however, by brandishing
the telegram before him. Directly he read it, the
change in his tone and manner was almost
ludicrous.</p>

<p>“Dear me!” he said. “How very good of
Stoddart. I’m very pleased, I’m sure. I congratulate
you heartily, my boy, very heartily. Laura,
will you please have the goodness to ring for
Jennings. We must celebrate this auspicious
occasion in the time-honoured way I think.”</p>

<p>“Hear, hear!” said the full assembly.</p>

<p>“Only time on record, Father, you know,” said
Grace, who was trying desperately hard to keep
her enthusiasm under restraint, “that Stoddy’s
ever taken two of one family together. And
who’ll say dreams are rot now?” she demanded
fiercely. “What price mine? Hasn’t it come true?”</p>

<p>“There’s no ‘name inadvertently omitted’ about
it, though,” said the literal Charlie.</p>

<p>“All the same,” said Archie, “it’s near enough
to give Grace no end of a reputation with the
Society of Psychical Research.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>“The Society of Sikey—what?” said Grace.
“Mustn’t it hurt you, Archie, to be so clever?”</p>

<p>The apparition of the butler, however, restored
the tone to the proceedings.</p>

<p>“I think, Jennings,” said the Rector, “that there
should be just two bottles of that champagne left
in the third bin. Will you please bring it up.”</p>

<p>“Miss Laura had it yesterday, sir,” said Jennings.</p>

<p>“Miss Laura had it yesterday, sir,” said the
Rector, with the majesty of an archbishop. “But
pray, sir, will you have the goodness to explain
what Miss Laura has to do with it?”</p>

<p>“Miss Laura came to me yesterday, sir,” said
Jennings apprehensively, “and told me to give her
the two remaining bottles. She said that she would
take all the responsibility, sir.”</p>

<p>“Quite right, Jennings,” said Grace, with a courageous
promptitude that I am afraid commanded
the admiration of us all. “I did say I would take
all the responsibility. You see it’s like this, Father.
I couldn’t give a lot of common grocery to a set
of county men, two of ’em going out with Stoddy,
could I?”</p>

<p>“There was only one of ’em going out with
Stoddy yesterday, though,” said her enemy of
Harrow.</p>

<p>“I’ll defy anybody to say that there’s not two
now, though,” said Grace. “And it was the Little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
Clumpton match, you know, Father; and it was an
awful hot day, an’ awful fagging, and I knew you
wouldn’t mind. Besides, I couldn’t have given anything
common to two men going out with Stoddy,
could I?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said her magnanimous parent, “on due
consideration, I’m inclined to think you couldn’t.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right then,” said Grace cheerfully.</p>

<p>To describe in detail the festivities attendant on
Charlie’s honours is by no means necessary, and
perhaps not altogether politic. All I need say is,
that it was such a shameful hour when the Optimist
and I remembered it was time to go home that
everybody simply scouted the idea.</p>

<p>“Oh no, you don’t,” said our hostess. “You’re
going to stay the night. Must have you in condition
for to-morrow’s match, you know, Dimmy.
Don’t want you to say when I’ve given you a most
frightful licking that you weren’t fit.”</p>

<p>“What match?” cried several of the curious.</p>

<p>“Dimmy knows,” said Grace.</p>

<p>“Oh, Dimmy knows, does he,” said Archie. “By
Jove! you men, I shouldn’t be a bit surprised if
Jimmy’s lost his pony.”</p>

<p>“What pony?” said Grace.</p>

<p>“Dimmy knows,” said Archie.</p>

<p>And to me, who had by far the most exact acquaintance
with the case, it was as good as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
comedy to witness their curiosity regarding the
whole affair.</p>

<p>“Laura,” said the Rector, who had been so borne
onwards by the general exultation of men and
things that he was breaking all his records in the
way of sitting up, “Laura, is it not time you went
to bed? It is after ten, I think, and that’s your
usual hour.”</p>

<p>“Well, look here, Father,” said his daughter;
“will you promise to see ’em all to bed? Please
<i>don’t</i> leave ’em up with that awful little Toddles.
Archie, Charlie, and Tom are playing against Kent
on Monday, and I can see his game. You will keep
your eye on ’em, won’t you, Father? Oh, and
just watch James’s game as well. He’s all right
in himself, you know, but when he gets with
Toddles, he’s likely to be led away.”</p>

<p>“I never heard such aspersions in the whole
course of my career,” said Toddles, taking forth a
white silk handkerchief, and religiously applying it
to his sorrow. “Grace, I’m overcome.”</p>

<p>“Don’t believe it,” said Miss Grace. “Toddles,
you’re a wrong ’un, and always were.”</p>

<p>“Dear me,” said the Rector, “Laura, where <i>do</i>
you find such expressions?”</p>

<p>“Now remember, Father,” said Miss Grace, opening
the door. “Oh, and you two have got to
stay. The best room in the house, too. It’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
the one King Charles II. slept in after the
battle of Worcester.”</p>

<p>“My dear girl,” said the Rector, who was evidently
deeply exercised on this point, “have I not
said over and over again that he did not sleep
there. He could not possibly have done so.”</p>

<p>“Well, all I can say is,” said Miss Grace, “that,
if that’s a fact, this is the only house in these parts
in which King Charles II. didn’t sleep after the
battle of Worcester. And that being so, I don’t see
why we haven’t as much right to him as anybody
else. But keep your eye on Toddles, won’t you,
Father. Breakfast at half-past ten, boys. That’s
when you like it, I know. Be good. Ta-ta.”</p>

<p>Amid a volley of “good-nights” and “ta-tas”
this extremely popular young person went to bed.
Loth as I am to say it, even her father did not see
fit to follow her example straight away. Events
had fired him. He drank the health of Charlie, and
he smoked the health of Charlie as sedulously as
any. In fact, no man contributed more to the
general undermining of Charlie’s health than he.
He told his old-time stories of the cricket field. He
also told some stories that were not of the cricket
field, but were not the less relished on that account.
He related how on one occasion on which he was
bowling he killed a swallow as it flew across the
pitch. And like the thorough cricketer he was he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
said that fact reminded him that he took nine
wickets for sixteen in that particular match.</p>

<p>Not wishing to incriminate any one, especially as
two of the company were Clerks in Holy Orders, I
do not intend to make any more definite statement
in regard to the hour at which we did retire, than to
say that it was after ten. But then no household in
England could have had quite such provocation.
Two members of one family going out with Stoddart
to represent the Old Country in the autumn! It
was enough to make an anchorite forego his way
of life.</p>

<p>The summer dawn was on the trees and peeping
through the blinds when at last the Optimist and I
appeared in the chamber of King Charles. The
birds in their dew-steeped branches were twittering
to the meadows and the cows. A cool, early fragrance
came through the open windows and filled
the room. Therefore, when the Optimist and I
climbed into our several beds of white, sweet-smelling
linen, and the young sun threw a stray
beam or two upon our pillows, the luxury of lying
awake was so much greater than that of going to
sleep, that after spending ten ineffectual minutes
in trying to do so, I gave it up as hopeless.</p>

<p>“Brightside,” said I, at the end of that period,
“are you asleep yet?”</p>

<p>“Not much, and shan’t be,” said he.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>“I wonder why we are like this?” said I.
“Seems funny, don’t it. Don’t feel a bit tired,
do you?”</p>

<p>“No,” said he, “only in the throat. Pollies and
Scotches always make it feel a bit weary. But
don’t those Trenthams touch ’em pretty. Awf’ly
nice chaps though, aren’t they? Extends to their
feminine faction too. I wonder why we can’t go
to sleep? Does seem funny, as you say.”</p>

<p>“Don’t it,” said I. “Have you any ’bacca?
mine’s all cleared.”</p>

<p>The Optimist reached for his coat and presently
dropped his pouch on to my eye. Thereon I sat
up in bed and lit a pipe.</p>

<p>“By the way,” said I, “I want to ask you what
colour you’d call Grace’s complexion?”</p>

<p>“Haven’t noticed it particularly,” said he, suppressing
a yawn.</p>

<p>“Brightside,” said I severely, “don’t lie. And
don’t yawn, because when you yawn you still lie.”</p>

<p>“Girls are a topic that bores one, you know,”
said he. “But I s’pose you did pop it. She
seemed rather familiar. She called you Dimmy.”</p>

<p>“You noticed that?” said I.</p>

<p>“Everybody noticed it,” said he. “And <i>did</i> you
pop it?”</p>

<p>“Like a brick,” said I.</p>

<p>“Then you’d better tell me all about it,” said he,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
exposing his hand at last. “Then perhaps we shall
both feel sleepier.”</p>

<p>Thereupon, without the exercise of the least piece
of pressure, I entered on a flowing, exhaustive and
frank relation.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br>

I Receive Instruction in a Heart-breaking Science</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AT the end of this exciting story, the Optimist
said:</p>

<p>“Quite a neat idea, this trial by cricket, from
one point of view. The point of view is hers.
It’s an attempt of course on the part of feminine
delicacy to let a fellow down gently. You
haven’t a thousand-to-one chance of beating her,
you know.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, old chap,” said I, “you’re a great
consolation. But I’m going to have such a good
try. Besides, although she’s a Trentham, she’s
also a girl.”</p>

<p>“Can you bowl?” said the Optimist, with brutal
brevity.</p>

<p>“Oh, damn!” said I, and proceeded to smoke
savagely for the space of three minutes, as my
manner was in some danger of losing its repose.</p>

<p>“Your bowling’s positively putrid,” the Optimist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
said. “And she can hit hard. Lots of the family
muscle, and her eye’s perfect.”</p>

<p>“I’m trusting to my batting,” said I.</p>

<p>“You’ll find it a broken reed,” said he, “when
you come to play her curly ones. You haven’t met
’em yet, have you?”</p>

<p>“No, worse luck,” said I.</p>

<p>“She’s got her guv’nor’s curl, you know. Horrible
things that swerve in the air and then break
back again. You heard what the boys said? And
they’ve not exaggerated ’em a bit. They’re indescribably
infernal.”</p>

<p>I tried to play the stoic. With this purpose in
view, I discarded my pipe and settled myself for
peace, perfect peace. But I was just as likely to
send down a good length ball as to get to sleep
just then.</p>

<p>“It’s no good malingering,” said the Optimist,
at the end of ten minutes; “you are no more in
slumber’s lap than I am.”</p>

<p>“Shut up, can’t you?” I said. “I was just in
a doze.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you face your position,” said he,
“as becomes a valiant man of Little Clumpton?
You’ve got to play Grace in an hour or two, and
yet the bowling at your command is incapable of
getting a girls’ school out. As I am truly anxious
that you shall bring no disgrace upon your club,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
might I suggest that you get a little practice before
the match begins?”</p>

<p>“Almost a suggestion for you,” said I. “Are
you willing to assist me?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll see you through with it,” said the Optimist,
who, I have reason to believe, was the most
unselfish person in the world. Let this explain,
then, how it came about that at a little before
eight, the pair of us dressed, and presently sallied
below to obtain a ball wherewith I might develop
the theory and practice of bowling. It was not, of
course, to be expected that our companions in the
late pious orgies would be yet abroad; indeed, we
felt ourselves to be quite early. It was not at all
a difficult affair to procure the article of which
we were in need, as the first domestic to whom
we broached the subject directed us to a receptacle
where bats, balls, stumps, pads, gloves and
“blanco” were heaped together in profuse disorder.
On sallying out to the lawn, however, the very
first object our eyes fell on gave us no inconsiderable
shock.</p>

<p>Miss Grace was assisting Biffin to prepare the
wicket with a small but apparently heavy hand-roller.
Involuntarily the pair of us, guilty as we
felt ourselves to be, made a motion to withdraw.
Alas! too late! we had been observed.</p>

<p>“Mornin’, Cheery; mornin’, Dimmy,” cried Miss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
Grace, in a voice as strong as a blackbird’s.
“Come and roll a bit. We’ve been at it an hour
or more.”</p>

<p>There was no alternative but somewhat reluctantly
to approach.</p>

<p>“Why, what an early bird you are!” I began.
“I thought you said breakfast was at half-past
ten.”</p>

<p>“For you idle men,” said she. “<i>I’ve</i> had one
already, and shall be ready for another by then.
’Must lend Biffin a hand; he’d never have these
wickets O.K. else.”</p>

<p>“What time does the match begin?” I asked, to
keep up the conversation, whilst I tried to smuggle
unseen the tell-tale ball into my coat.</p>

<p>“Wicket pitched at twelve o’clock,” said Grace.
“And it’s all right, Dimmy, I saw you. You can
fetch it out again. You want to do a bit of bowling,
don’t you? Want to find a bit of a length?
Well, if you’ll just roll a few up I’ll give you
some tips.”</p>

<p>Impatient Reader, I ask you to conceive the situation!
Conceive the irony, the pathos! Here was
the very person I was trying to overcome in deadly
combat, having the audacity to show me how to
set about it. A person of a more sanguine
temperament, the Optimist for instance, might
have argued from these premises that the enemy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
was actually courting defeat. But I knew by the
half-pitying, half-contemptuous way in which the
offer was made, that it sprang from her own joyous
self-confidence, and that she was inclined to regard
me as a foe who not for a single moment was to
be considered seriously.</p>

<p>Grace’s keen eye and her deductive faculty made
me decidedly uncomfortable. It is not nice to be
found out and then be so ruthlessly exposed. And
I regret to say that the Optimist, who had nothing
at stake, was sufficiently human to enjoy my misfortune.</p>

<p>“Who told you what Dimsdale was up to?” he
said. I believe that it is no injustice to the Optimist
to state that he was trying to prolong my pain.</p>

<p>“Was it <i>very</i> clever of me?” said Grace. “Do
you know it makes me laugh awfully to see the
way you men try to dodge and hedge and that
sort o’ thing. You’re that horribly clumsy. There
was old Dimmy’s face saying as plain as print,
‘Don’t look, <i>please</i>, till I’ve put it away, will you?’
But let’s have that ball, old chap, and I’ll see if I
can’t lick you into shape a bit. I <i>do</i> mean to do
the right thing by you, you know.”</p>

<p>Pitching a single stump on yesterday’s wicket,
she got behind it, and caused me to begin bowling
from the opposite crease. The first ball I tried
to deliver almost wrenched my unaccustomed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
right arm from its socket. It pitched about halfway
down and trickled along the ground till it
ultimately rolled a good yard wide of the mark.
My tutor raised her brows with a mild air of
protest.</p>

<p>“My dear man,” she said, “is that what you
call bowling? It strikes me that it’s more like
bowls than anything.”</p>

<p>“I’m only loosening my arm, you know,” said I
weakly.</p>

<p>“Keep pegging away,” said she, valiantly suppressing
a smile.</p>

<p>Fancy the other side adopting this kind of tone.
And the Optimist <i>was</i> enjoying it.</p>

<p>“Cheery,” said Grace, “go and lend a hand to
Biffin. There is he tugging away like a horse,
and you stand grinning at him.”</p>

<p>“It was not at Biffin, I can assure you,” the
Optimist said.</p>

<p>“I must have been mistaken then,” said the
adroit Grace; “it was only your way of looking
interested.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, it was not,” said the Optimist, “I was
laughing at——”</p>

<p>“Don’t interrupt, please,” said my tutor, “and
don’t argue.”</p>

<p>Really my tutor was the very essence of good
breeding! I continued to bowl without enjoyment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
without inspiration, without conviction even. For
I was distressingly alive to the fact that my bowling
was exactly what bowling ought not to be.
To adopt the technical language of my tutor: “It’s
a good length, Dimmy, <i>at your own end</i>. Be careful,
old chap, or you’ll trap your toes.”</p>

<p>It had neither length, nor pace, nor direction. It
had absolutely nothing to recommend it. There
was a timidity, a meekness, an air of apology
about it that positively invited batsmen to hit it
very hard indeed.</p>

<p>“You really must get your arm a bit higher,”
said my tutor. “Bring it right over, you know.
And get your fingers round the seam—so; only two
besides the thumb. Tuck t’others underneath a
bit, and give ’em a sort of jerk, and flick your
wrist a bit just as you deliver.”</p>

<p>“Ye-es,” said I; “ye-es, ye-es.”</p>

<p>“Got the idea?” said Grace.</p>

<p>“Perfectly,” said I.</p>

<p>“Let’s see you do it then.”</p>

<p>Alas! I did do it, and the ball went spinning
out of my hand at right angles, and hit Biffin
very tenderly on the head.</p>

<p>“That’s how you get ‘devil,’ you know,” said my
tutor, with a very kindergarten kind of air, and
pretending at the same time to be quite unconscious
of this melancholy incident.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>“It’s <i>the</i> devil,” I said simply.</p>

<p>“I must show you how to do it,” said my tutor.</p>

<p>“Do, please, by all means,” said I quickly.</p>

<p>I was, of course, as a batsman and an opponent,
particularly anxious to obtain a private view of
her celebrated bowling. And the specimen she
did send down, said as clearly as possible that
report had not overpraised her prowess. There
was a mastery, an ease, and a combination of
qualities therein that said here was a born bowler.
Hers, as has been remarked, was an Alfred Shaw
style of action, only that in accordance with the
modern theory she brought her arm as high over
as she could possibly get it. She was decidedly
slow, but possessed the necessary and fatal “nip,”
and to see the ball curl one way from her hand,
and then the moment it dropped quickly twist
in the opposite direction was, to a batsman who
had got to face it presently, little short of alarming.</p>

<p>“Why,” I cried, “why, Grace, your bowling’s
perfectly magnificent!”</p>

<p>“Oh no, Dimmy, it’s not,” said Grace. “It’s
quite common or garden. If I’d got a bit more
pace now it might do things. But with more pace
I can’t get the break, and that’s what makes me
so sick. The Guv’nor could, you know. He was
a bowler if you like. I’ve bowled at Biffin for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
hours an’ hours, yet if I begin to try medium the
‘work’ don’t act.”</p>

<p>My tutor uttered this in a tragic tone.</p>

<p>“I don’t care what your pace is,” said I, carried
away by her beautiful delivery, her perfect length,
her “nip,” her “devil,” her break, and, above all,
her parent’s curl in the air, which was an undoubted
case of heredity, “but your bowling’s
magnificent.”</p>

<p>“Oh, rot!” said Grace. “It ought to be faster.”</p>

<p>“It’s perfectly magnificent,” said I.</p>

<p>“Oh, rot!” said Grace again. “Do you think
I don’t know when bowling’s real A 1? Too
slow for a quick-footed bat. He’s got time to get
out and hit me most horrid. Didn’t you see Archie
lift me clean over that jolly old tent. Wasn’t it
a smasher? I did feel prickly. I’d kept ’em <i>so</i>
short, and as soon as I did pitch one up a bit that’s
how he served me.”</p>

<p>“By Jove!” said I; “that’s what I’ll do. It’s
not quite my game, you know, but I’m hanged if
I don’t go out and hit you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you will,” said the enemy, with a gleam in
her eye. “We’ll see about that. Rectory rules,
you know, and lots of fielders.”</p>

<p>Judged in this light, my new scheme was not
quite so good as it at first appeared.</p>

<p>“We <i>are</i> a pair of jays, aren’t we,” said Grace,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
with amazing friendliness. “Here we’ve both
gone and given ourselves away. You’ve shown
me all about your stuff, and I’ve shown you all
about mine.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said, “we’ve certainly exposed our
hands. Rather a joke. But I never thought about
it at all.”</p>

<p>“Nor I,” said she. “But this I will say, Dimmy.
Now that I’ve seen the sort o’ tosh you <i>do</i> bowl,
I’m certain that I shall have just a walk over.
I always guessed it was pretty bad, your bowling,
but I didn’t think it could be quite the giddy
essence of utterness that it really is. If you’ll
take my tip you’ll try lobs. I <i>might</i> get into
two minds with those, you know, as nobody’s
quite happy with lobs. Your other sort, though,
won’t have me out in a season. I should advise
you to scratch. You’ll have an awful time if you
don’t. I’m speaking plain as a friend, old chap.”</p>

<p>“So beastly good of you to be so beastly
friendly,” said I gloomily.</p>

<p>The downright Grace certainly meant to behave
nicely. Her advice was perfectly well-meant and
sincere; but how impossible it was to take it! I
would prefer to sacrifice my personal dignity
rather than my opportunity. Besides, her complete
indifference to the result of our encounter was a
great humiliation in itself. Could she have by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
any chance forgotten the stakes for which I was to
play? I deemed it wise to sound her.</p>

<p>“Well, I will scratch on one condition,” said I.</p>

<p>“My dear Dimmy,” said she, “I’m not asking a
favour, you know. Entirely in your own interests,
I can assure you. You are at liberty to play the
match or scratch it as you just please. Matter of
perfect indifference to me, you know. Merely
suggested scratching to spare you a tremendous
licking. Don’t matter to me personally one way
or the other, a little bit.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it don’t,” said I, feeling both hot and emotional;
and had a traction-engine been taking the
liberty of going over me, I don’t think I could have
felt more crushed.</p>

<p>“Why should it?” said Grace, gazing at me with
big-eyed demureness.</p>

<p>“My dear Grace,” said I; “my dear Grace.”</p>

<p>Her eyes grew bigger.</p>

<p>“What’s up, old chap?” said she.</p>

<p>“You’re not forgetting,” I said anxiously;
“you’re not forgetting, I hope, what this match
means to me. You promised to give my claims the
most serious consideration if I won, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>Grace’s reply was laughter. I sought to compensate
my injuries a little by persuading myself that
this ebullience on the part of Grace was in the worst
possible taste. But this I knew to be a chimera,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
raised from the ruins of my self-esteem; for Grace
was that forthright, fearless kind of soul who had
only to do a thing to create the precedent for it.
Somehow she seemed quite unable to lose her
breeding for a moment, as, by some strange oversight,
the science of snobbery had been omitted
from her education altogether. Therefore she did
not spend her time in committing the very solecisms
that she strove most to avoid. Could she
have been bred in England?</p>

<p>This trite reflection, Impatient Reader, is not
really a digression, but is a device introduced to
allow Grace full time to have her laugh out. When
it was ended at last, I said mildly:—</p>

<p>“What’s the joke, Grace?”</p>

<p>“Why, the joke is that you’ve not got the
slightest earthly, my dear chap,” said Grace.
“Else do you think I’d have taken those absurd
conditions?”</p>

<p>This was comforting in the extreme! It was no
more than I deserved though. But my imperial
Anglo-Saxon rose in all the majesty of his
Rudyard Kipling.</p>

<p>“All right,” said I; “but this is going to be no
walk over. I’m going all the way, I can tell you,
Grace. A game’s never won till it’s lost.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad you’re cheerful,” said Grace, “’cause
your gruelling’ll be so prime that you’ll want a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
<i>dreadful</i> lot of cheerfulness. It just makes me
shudder to think what’ll happen to you, Dimmy.”</p>

<p>“You can’t intimidate me,” said I; “you can’t
make me funk you.”</p>

<p>“That’ll come later,” said Grace, “when you
go on to bowl!”</p>

<p>“Cricket, cricket, and still cricket!”</p>

<p>It was the voice of the Rector, who had come
upon us unobserved.</p>

<p>“Mornin’, Father,” said his daughter. “All
serene this morning? You were reading Livy
rather late last night, weren’t you? Oh, you
literary men, your hours are dreadful!”</p>

<p>“If you are too ironical,” said the Rector,
accepting the cheek she so promptly offered him—yes,
I mean in both a figurative and a <i>literal</i> sense.
I certainly intended no pun, but if one has to
deal with the confounded English language, how
<i>is</i> one to avoid its pitfalls?—“If you are too
ironical,” said the Rector, “I’ll preach a fifty
minutes’ sermon to-morrow, Laura.”</p>

<p>As was subsequently explained, this was quite
the most effective means of dealing with the misdemeanours
of Miss Grace.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX<br>

A Case for M.C.C.</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">CONTRARY to expectation, breakfast was dispatched
in sufficiently reasonable time to
permit my match with Grace to start about eleven.
Needless to say, Grace herself arranged the details.
The seven cricketers who were not playing on this
occasion, instead of being allowed to act the part
of mere lookers-on, received orders to field for both
sides. “And, Toddles,” said Grace, in an intimidating
tone, “if you drop Dimmy and then take
me, I’ll never forgive you.” Her father, to my
great uneasiness, was to be installed as scorer,
under his usual convenient willow tree; and the
notorious Biffin she proposed to nominate as umpire.
Acting on the joint advice of Toddles and
Archie, I entered a formal protest against Biffin
being allowed to stand in this important fixture.
This matter, which involved much more than I
had suspected, was debated at the breakfast-table.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Grace, “you’ve nothing against
Biffin’s personal character, I hope?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>“Oh, no,” said I; “it’s only that he don’t quite
command my confidence, you know.”</p>

<p>“How funny!” said Grace; “’cause I have
every confidence in Biffin. He knows the game,
his eyesight’s good, his decisions are as prompt as
possible, and his judgment’s wonderful. Can’t expect
more of an umpire, can you? Of course, he
might be better looking, but that’s his misfortune,
poor man! Besides, I never think it’s wise to
have an umpire who’s too good-looking. One’s
liable to watch him, instead of the ball, don’t
you see.”</p>

<p>“Dimsdale, don’t you be bluffed,” said Charlie.
“She’s a regular Arthur Roberts at the game of
bluff. She knows as well as anybody that Biffin’s
umpiring is worth about five hundred runs a year
to her. The darned impudent decisions I’ve seen
that bounder Biffin give are something cruel. If
he’s given her in once, he’s given her in six times
when she’s been stumped yards out of her ground,
simply on account of the tip of the wicket-keeper’s
nose being in front of the wicket. Pretty barefaced
to come it once, but six times is what I
should call immoral.”</p>

<p>“Shows his knowledge o’ the game,” said Biffin’s
defender, “and his attention to the fine points of
it, too. There’s lots of umpires ’ud not have noticed
that, and I should have had to have gone out.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>“They’d not, that’s a cert.,” said Charlie; “and
that you would have had to have gone out is a dead
cert.”</p>

<p>“I s’pose, Charlie,” said Grace, “that the tip o’
the wicket-keeper’s nose <i>is</i> a part of his person,
isn’t it? And Rule 42 says——”</p>

<p>“Here, no more cucumbers!” cried T. S. M.
hastily.</p>

<p>“Dimsdale, don’t you budge,” said Carteret.
“If you consent to Biffin, you’ll be shamefully
rooked.”</p>

<p>“What’s Dimmy got to do with it?” said Grace.
“Is Dimmy the M.C.C., or what? If I say Biffin’s
going to stand, Biffin will stand, and don’t you
think he won’t; ’cause if you do, you’ll be in
error.”</p>

<p>“Go it, Lord Harris!” said Toddles. “Just
hear Harris! Oh, you autocratic person! Talk
about George, why, you’re worse than a colonel
of militia!”</p>

<p>The case was being conducted with great
fervour by both sides. There was quite a formidable
array of counsel for the prosecution. Indeed,
Grace’s defence of the indefensible Biffin had for
once caused her to stand absolutely alone. She
was no whit abashed, though. Nor did she descend
to mere argument. She was thoroughly satisfied
with her own opinion, and was prepared to enforce<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
it in the teeth of male criticism of the most destructive
kind.</p>

<p>“Biffin’s an unmitigated ruffian,” said Archie.
“And if I can help it, he’ll never stand again.”</p>

<p>“But you can’t help it, Archie,” said his sister;
“’cause if I want him to stand, he will stand, don’t
you see?”</p>

<p>“He’s an unprincipled person,” said the little
parson. “And I marvel that Grace’s moral nature
can countenance him.”</p>

<p>“I’ll have a bob each way on ‘moral nature,’
Toddles,” said Grace.</p>

<p>“His umpirin’s too thick to talk about,” said
T. S. M. “Why, at Harrow——”</p>

<p>“Yes, at Harrow,” said Grace. This prompt
seizure of her opportunity was of no avail, however.
Public opinion was now entirely with
T. S. M. Poor Grace stood alone. She consoled
herself with a massive piece of toast, with butter
and marmalade to match.</p>

<p>“Seeing that Dimsdale’s happiness is at stake,”
said Toddles, with an air of patronage and protection
that was perfectly insufferable, “we shall do
well to stick by him in this, and give him our undivided
support. We’ll admit that he’s not much
chance under the most favourable conditions; but
with Biffin as umpire he’s as good as plucked
before he goes on the field. Besides, we want this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
to be a sporting event. Fair play all round, you
know, and no favour, and may the best man win.”</p>

<p>“Toddles,” said the keen Grace, pausing an
instant in her well-organized assault on the toast
and marmalade, “you’re mixed. Sort yourself out
a bit. Toddles, you’re talking rot.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but, my dear Grace,” said I, “it’s not rot
for me, I can assure you. It’s a matter for earnest
consideration.”</p>

<p>It was really enjoyable to feel such a weight of
public opinion behind one. It was evidently a crisis
that had been coming slowly to a head for years.
Here was the opportunity of the long-suffering to
test the legality of Grace’s uncompromising attitude
on the Biffin question. In the somewhat technical
language of the barrister, they were simply making
a test case of it, in order to get a judicial pronouncement
as to whether in future Grace was to be
licensed to do as she liked.</p>

<p>“O’ course I shall, James,” said Grace; “I always
do, don’t I?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what,” said Archie, “I suggest that
the question be submitted to arbitration. We’ll
submit it to the Guv’nor, and take his verdict as
final. Will you agree to that, Grace?”</p>

<p>“You know quite well, Archie,” said Grace, in a
honeyed voice, “that I am always perfectly willing
for you to fill up your spare time in a way that’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
profitable and amusing to yourself, providing it’s
not likely to do you personally any harm, or to lead
astray those who are younger than you are. Talk
it over by all means with your father, Archie, but
if I say Biffin will stand, you can take my word
for it.”</p>

<p>The high-wrought state of public opinion, that
was enough to make the French pause and the Sultan
tremble, merely appeared to incite the dauntless
Grace to new audacity. She positively snapped
her fingers at it, and ate her toast and marmalade
with an air of the most victorious unconcern.</p>

<p>“H’m,” said the little parson, in his best clerical
tone; “she seems to be a person of character and
ideas. What’s to be done? We can’t let Dimsdale
be knocked down and walked over on an occasion of
this sort. Grace, I certainly think that your uncompromising
attitude on this vexed question is
greatly to be deplored.”</p>

<p>“Deplore away,” said Grace, helping herself to
butter. “What an amusing little man you are,
Toddles!”</p>

<p>Affairs were at a deadlock. How was it possible
to negotiate if one side would insist on having its
own way?</p>

<p>“It’s a sort of diplomatic <i>impasse</i>,” said Archie.
“What’s to be done? Suppose we take Biffin by
main force and put him under the cucumber frame,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
and keep him fastened down? There’d be no more
bad decisions then.”</p>

<p>“Plenty of bad language, though,” said some
person of wit.</p>

<p>“And we wouldn’t release him,” said Carteret,
“until Grace had actually played an innings without
damaging the eyesight of the cucumbers or
otherwise mutilating them.”</p>

<p>“I call Grace’s behaviour beas’ly bad form,” said
the Harrow captain.</p>

<p>“Oh, I know it’s beastly bad form,” said Grace;
“but then, you see, Tommy, one has to play pretty
low down to gain the appreciation of one’s family.”</p>

<p>Had Grace’s cause only been a just one, the
manner in which she maintained it against all
comers must have evoked unqualified admiration.
The cabal was powerless in the face of her despotic
attitude. They said hard things, and they said
rude things, as brothers will, even if they have a
sister who is a first-class angel of an unimpeachable
appearance. But although Grace stood alone,
discredited, out of favour, a fallen idol, and a mark
for some very cutting observations, mostly the
Harrow captain’s, who saw his moment, and, boylike,
was exulting in it—despite all this, Grace
continued to consume toast and marmalade as
valiantly as ever. Now and then she diversified
this proceeding by looking daggers at Toddles,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
when that irrepressible little clergyman made faces
at her. Now and then she introduced a brief
remark on her own account, that on examination
proved to be as flinty and hard-edged as a chip of
granite. It was plain that the exercise of a considerable
force of character had been the secret of
Grace’s ascendancy and pre-eminence in regard to
these great men. And having obtained her power,
she did not hesitate to abuse it, as they say her sex
generally do.</p>

<p>“In my opinion,” said Archie, “there’s been a
mistake in Grace’s destiny. Her arrogance and
sweet unreasonableness makes her look a bit out of
drawing, I think. Strikes me that Nature planned
her for a Gladstone or a Mailyphist, and then made
her a girl for fun. But I believe she simply doesn’t
care what we think of her.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I do, you know, Archie,” said Grace;
“I’m as cut up as can be. I’m quite put off my
game. You had better let us have some more
toast, Jane. Toddles, pass the marmalade—and the
butter. Yes, I think I’ll have the butter, too.”</p>

<p>However, in my eyes Grace’s splendid isolation
had such a nobility, such a dignity, such a pathos
of its own, that it struck me with some suddenness
that a little magnanimity might not be altogether
out of place. It was patent, however, that her
brothers had such firm convictions on the point<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
at issue that they were not likely to exercise it.
Therefore, I had a try myself.</p>

<p>“My dear Grace,” said I, “don’t let’s worry about
Biffin any more. <i>I’m</i> perfectly willing for him to
stand, you know.”</p>

<p>“What!” cried the whole table with one voice.</p>

<p>Yet I ask you what could a fellow do under the
circumstances? Splendid isolation is magnificent,
of course, but not being one of Grace’s brothers,
how could I help pitying the isolated?</p>

<p>The storm of contumely that my unconditional
surrender provoked was woeful. Even the gallant
Optimist reviled me. Their unanimity was crushing.
It was not the question at issue that mattered
so much; it was the general principle. It always
is the general principle. They considered themselves
betrayed. They had pledged themselves and
their interests entirely in <i>my</i> cause, and then I
calmly go over to the other side and merge that
cause in the enemy’s. In fact, in the impassioned
language of Toddles, the more they examined the
fine points of my conduct, the deeper the iron
entered into their souls.</p>

<p>“Jolly good o’ the iron,” said Grace; “improve
’em no end. Been wanting a tonic a long time.”</p>

<p>Grace, indeed, I am glad to state, took an entirely
different view of my behaviour. Never had I seen
her face so brightly eloquent as when she laid
down her coffee-cup and looked at me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>“Dimmy,” said she, “you’re a good sort, that’s
what you are—a ripping good sort. Dimmy,
you’re A 1!”</p>

<p>Her tone implied that she meant it, too. And
really it was decidedly consoling to feel that we
stood together facing scorn and disfavour on every
hand. But it seemed that the tactful Grace knew
how, when, and where to be generous. Or, no, I’m
quite sure her generosity was not studied at all. It
was just unaided nature!</p>

<p>“Look here, you men,” said she; “as Dimmy’s
such a good sort, he’s not going to be such a good
sort, do you see? No, I don’t mean that exactly; I
mean——”</p>

<p>“If it’s sheer cheek that you mean, which we’ve
every reason to fear that it is,” said Toddles,
“we shall be very grateful if you’ll be content to
consider it said. If we have any more before
lunch I’m thinking that some of the batting won’t
be of a very high order at Tonbridge on Monday.”</p>

<p>“That’ll do, Toddles,” said Grace. “Have a rest
now, there’s a good little man. What was I
saying? Oh, as Dimmy’s done the right thing, I’m
going to do the right thing, too. Father, will you
stand to-day, please?”</p>

<p>A rousing cheer greeted this announcement.</p>

<p>“I’ve always said,” remarked George, “that more
can be done by the kindness method in the treatment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
of these wild natures than cruelty, firearms,
and that sort of thing. Here’s Grace lying down
now, apparently as tame and docile as a kitten,
without the use of red-hot irons or anything of
the kind. And it’s so much better than burning
her fur, don’t you know.”</p>

<p>The Rector consenting to stand, the affair terminated.
Biffin, for that day at least, had to be
content with the humbler functions of the scorer.</p>

<p>Breakfast over, we trooped out into the sun. And
as we did so I am free to confess that my attire
was a trifle irregular. Carteret being the most
medium-built man amongst us, except in the
matter of girth, and, therefore, the most resembling
me, had very kindly lent me his buckskins;
Charlie lent me one of his shirts, which, to
my infinite pleasure, he assured me was the one he
wore in the ’Varsity match, when he got so many
Oxford wickets, and paid so very little for them;
while Archie subscribed the identical pair of unmentionables
in which he made his record score against
Sussex at Brighton last year. In passing, it should
be noted that record scores have quite a habit of
getting themselves made against Sussex at Brighton.
It is probably the sea air.</p>

<p>Despite this peculiar and rather extensive outfit,
and an unbiassed umpire withal, I was earnestly
assured that I could not possibly have a look in.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
In fact, Grace was popularly supposed to be invincible
in single combat under Rectory rules, on the
Rectory wicket. A copy of the rules aforesaid was
duly deposited in the Rector’s hands before the
match began. And, although I was privileged to
peruse them, the one conclusion to which they
helped me was, that although the laws of the M.C.C.
had very kindly and thoughtfully provided nine
several ways in which a batsman might get out,
those of the Rectory had most generously furnished
nine and ninety.</p>

<p>I’ll admit at once that I had not the least confidence
in myself. Everybody took a simple-minded
pleasure in telling me that Grace never had been
beaten single-handed on her own playing-piece.</p>

<p>“My boy,” said the little parson, with his excruciating
friendliness, “that brown-haired, brown-faced,
brown-booted, brown-hollanded person,
familiarly known as Grace, is as full of wiles,
tricks, and low devices as a certain person with a
toasting-fork and a curly tail whom I shall not
even permit myself to mention. If you can take
Grace down a peg, posterity becomes your servant.
Your fame will be for all time, your name
will be in Wisden. For I believe I’m right in
saying that under these conditions Grace would
knock spots off half the Middlesex eleven.”</p>

<p>“Certain of it,” said Archie pleasantly. “She’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
a holy terror; and the charm of it is, Dimsdale,
that she never has made a secret of what she’s
going to do to you.”</p>

<p>“Why should I?” said Grace. “I’m going to
give him a most awful licking for last night’s
horrible behaviour.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said I meekly; “lick away.”</p>

<p>“Dimmy,” said she, “if I don’t, I’ll give you a
scarf-pin.”</p>

<p>“I shall require more than a scarf-pin,” said I.
And the emphasis I used was unmistakable.</p>

<p>“By Jove!” said Grace, “I was forgetting <i>that</i>.
Thanks for the reminder, old chap. Will you call,
or shall I?”</p>

<p>Next moment Grace had won the toss.</p>

<p>“Dimmy,” said she, “as your bowling’s so
thoroughly depressing, and you’re not likely to
have <i>me</i> out in a year, I think you’d better bat
first. Get your pads on.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX<br>

A Case for Another Eminent Authority</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN I buckled on Toddles’ pads I had all
the symptoms of a bad attack. I was a
trifle dizzy, I was half blind, my heart just seemed
to be trying what it could do, while my limbs were
equally irresponsible. There was a great jug of
cider laid on a table under the trees, and the
Optimist would insist on my taking a draught
of it, ere I went in to bat.</p>

<p>Grace placed her field with consummate care.
Everybody was laughing as I took my guard.</p>

<p>“Don’t think he’ll stay three minutes,” said
Carteret, quite audibly. Had Carteret only known,
it was the kind of remark to make me stay three
hours. That slice of Anglo-Saxon in my constitution,
that I have already had occasion to advertise,
objects above all things to be walked over rough-shod.
I knit my teeth. I determined to perish or
prevail. That moment, though, I should have been
very well satisfied had the perishing anticipated
itself by occurring there and then.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>Grace’s bowling was much as I had judged it
to be. I knew her hereditary peculiarities would
take a terrible amount of negotiating. And they
certainly did. The very first ball I turned half
round to, with the idea of getting it away to leg,
whereon the flight, slow as it was, so deceived me
that had it not been for my exceedingly thoughtful
and well-trained right leg I should have suffered
the humiliation of being clean bowled middle
stump.</p>

<p>“How’s that?” cried Grace.</p>

<p>“Didn’t pitch straight,” said the Rector.</p>

<p>I sighed my deep relief.</p>

<p>“There she goes,” said T. S. M. from extra cover.
“Begins her games at once. If Biffin had been
standin’ it would have been ‘Hout, Miss!’ sure as
a gun. Lucky for you, Dimsdale.”</p>

<p>“Tommy,” said Grace, “will you have the goodness
to change places with Toddles at short-leg?
Very close in please, Tommy. I’m going to bowl
a few half-volleys just outside the leg stick; so
you will look out for your face, won’t you? And
you won’t funk ’em, will you, Tommy? And young
boys shouldn’t be quite so jolly cheeky, should
they?”</p>

<p>In addition to her curl, there were several other
things appertaining to Grace’s bowling that required
watching. Her length was perfect, and, strangely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
enough, like her model the great Alfred Shaw, she
had acquired the trick of heightening and lowering
her delivery without any appreciable change in the
action, but a pretty considerable amount in the
flight. And, better than this, or worse, she was
mistress in a measure of the painfully difficult art
of making occasional balls “hang.” Although the
Rectory wicket was well-nigh perfect, one had to
watch her all the way, and then be prepared to
alter one’s tactics at the last moment. She could
make them “do a bit” both ways, and, in addition
to all these accomplishments, she had the imperturbable
temperament of the really great bowler—she
didn’t mind being hit. That attitude of mind
is undoubtedly the hall-mark of the master. She
kept pitching up to me in the most audacious way.
But I resolutely refused to “have a go,” until at
last she had the downright impudence to send me
a particularly slow full toss to leg, which I, of
course, promptly cracked to the fence for four.</p>

<p>“Thought you wouldn’t be able to resist that,”
she said winningly. “And do have a smack at
this, Dimmy, just for fun.”</p>

<p>“This” was a particularly silly-looking half-volley
well on the leg-side also. Having tasted
the delights of a fourer so recently, I was naturally
a bit headstrong and uplifted. I had a full
sweep at it, and in the heat of the moment utterly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
ignored the fatal curl. As a consequence I caught
it on the extreme end of my bat, and it went
spinning up a considerable height, straight into
the hands of mid-on. My very soul groaned.
To be caught napping so absurdly and so palpably!
My emotions were so bitter that gall becomes
honey by comparison. For I had walked
into the trap with my eyes open.</p>

<p>Now the Optimist was the fieldsman at mid-on.
And the dear, kind Optimist, most unselfish of
men, had a fellow feeling that made him wondrous
kind! The Optimist shaped for the catch
in the crudest manner. He dropped me inexcusably
in consequence. It was idle of him to urge,
as urge he did, that the sun was in his eyes, and
that he couldn’t see the catch. As the bowler
fiercely pointed out, the sun was directly behind
him.</p>

<p>“It must have been the shadow, then,” said the
Optimist unblushingly. The roars of laughter that
greeted his unscrupulous behaviour and his subsequent
effrontery were infectious. Even the
Rector contributed a hearty guffaw.</p>

<p>“Little Clumpton’s sold you this time!” cried
T. S. M. in ecstasy. “You may be very clever,
Grace, but you’ve just got left.”</p>

<p>The bowler’s dignity and self-restraint were
really very fine, however. “He’ll simply get it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
all the worse when I go in,” was her Spartan
answer.</p>

<p>“We shall all take <i>extremely</i> great care to collar
anything you put up, though,” said T.S.M., “so
you’d better play <i>piano</i> till you’ve got the runs off.”</p>

<p>Grace continued to bowl even wilier and slower
than before. Runs were very difficult to obtain,
but, nevertheless, I warily, cautiously obtained a
few. The bulk of them were made by means of
leg touches and pushes, and occasional big singles
into the country. She was too slow to cut; behind-the-wicket
strokes were, by Rectory rules and
the laws of single wicket also, ineligible. But I
was able once to regale myself with a hit past cover
for three. This was the only time, however, that
I got a chance to play my favourite stroke, as the
bowler was evidently of opinion that it was too
expensive to feed. I had made twenty-three by
careful play when I got into two minds with one
that curled outrageously, and hung as well. I
returned it as tamely as possible to the bowler, who
clasped it lovingly and said: “Poor old Dimmy!
Did ’um, then!”</p>

<p>Thereon she walked off under the trees to a
little light and liquid refreshment, which for her
partook of the nature of that innocuous concoction
known as stone-ginger; whilst I ruefully unbuckled
the pads of the ironical Toddles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>All things considered, I felt that I had no reason
to be dissatisfied with my score. Twenty-three
was quite the maximum of what I had expected
to get, as from the first I had not been disposed
to under-rate the excellence of Grace’s bowling.
Indeed, she was kind enough to say herself, in a
reflective tone,—</p>

<p>“Your batting’s really very decent, Dimmy, very
decent, indeed, you know. So glad you watch the
ball. Strikes me you’re the sort o’ man to get runs
on a bad wicket. With a bit more experience you
ought to do things. Oughtn’t he, boys?”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course,” said T. S. M. “If he can get
twenty-three against your bowlin’ he must be
phenomenal. Reg’lar freak—fit for Barnum!”</p>

<p>“You’ve never got twenty-three against it,
Tommy, anyhow,” said Grace.</p>

<p>“Such a beas’ly bore, don’t-cher-know,” said
the Harrow captain wearily, “to keep hittin’ girls
to the fence, and then havin’ to go and fag after
it for ’em.”</p>

<p>“Why, you know quite well, Tommy,” said his
sister, in a very pained voice, “that I’ve never let
you fetch a ball for me in your life. No, never.
It’s shameful of you, Tommy, to talk like that,
’cause it’s not true. Look here, you men, it’s not
true, is it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, no,” said Toddles. “You’d scorn to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
do it, Grace. We all know that. You’re far too
good a sportsman—I mean sportswoman.”</p>

<p>“Stick to the man,” said Grace. “Sounds so
much primer, somehow.”</p>

<p>“What’s Toddles up to now?” said Charlie suspiciously.
“Whenever he talks to Grace in that
kind of way there’s something behind it. Does he
want to smoke in the drawing-room, or is it breakfast
in bed? Grace, distrust that man. Last time
he was allowed to put sugar in his tea with his
fingers, instead of the tongs.”</p>

<p>“I like that,” said Grace. “Why, that’s what
you all do, you horrible creatures! Even Dimmy
does.”</p>

<p>“‘Even Dimmy does!’” repeated Archie.
“That’s your batting, my boy.”</p>

<p>And as I actually saw Grace blush at Archie’s
pointed remark I began to persuade myself that
it really must be my batting.</p>

<p>When Grace went in, she did not put on pads,
for a sufficient reason, but it amused us all, and
particularly her parent, to see her don a right-hand
batting glove.</p>

<p>“It’s all right, father,” said she. “Sha’n’t need
it, of course. It’s only out of respect for Dimmy,
you know. Looks a bit cheeky to go in with
nothing on, as though you were only playing golf
or marbles, or something like that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>“Or having a bath,” said Toddles, <i>sotto voce</i>.</p>

<p>It was characteristic of Grace that she never
held people guilty of laughing directly at <i>her</i>.
And I am not sure, either, whether this simpleness
of mind did not spring from a sublime faith in
herself and all her works. Certainly when she
set about getting the twenty-four runs necessary
for my defeat, she proceeded to wipe them off in
a magnificently confident manner. My first three
balls yielded five.</p>

<p>This certainly would not do. I must try lobs.
But why, oh, why had my youth been so grievously
misspent? Oh, why, I asked myself in the
bitterness of my spirit had I always been bat in
hand at the nets, slogging away for hours, instead
of doing now and then a little honest bowling?
It made me giddy to think of what service a decent
length and a fair command of the ball would be
to me at this moment. Oh, if I could only bowl!
If I could only bowl! Young men, I exhort you
to heed these awful consequences. Batting in
itself is very alluring, but there are other things
in cricket besides a cut for four, delightful as
that is. When the other side are in, it is well to
have a dim idea of how to get them out. At this
dread hour, owing to the errors of my childhood,
I had not, alas! the remotest notion how to do
so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>Nevertheless, the veiled jeers of the field, the
frank amusement of the umpire, and the downright
contempt of the person wielding the willow,
made my Anglo-Saxon once more rise within me.
Grace’s does-he-call-this-bowling air was most
exasperating. But I still went on in my dogged,
defiant, get-there-sometime style. I might be without
hope, but I was determined that the enemy
should not know it.</p>

<p>Bowling slow, elementary, underhand twisters,
I kept running after them up the pitch in a frankly
dare-devil manner, and several times took red-hot
cracks travelling to mid-off about ten yards
from Grace’s bat. Runs continued to come, however,
just as they thought fit apparently, but my
fielding was so whole-hearted that broad grins
presently succeeded derisive smiles on the faces
of those who witnessed it. But the five became
fifteen in no time. Nine more and all was over.
The imminence of disaster nerved me to superhuman
efforts. Grace mistimed one ball a little,
and as it rose from her bat for a short distance,
I sprawled arms and legs up the pitch, and literally
hurled myself at it. I just contrived to touch
it with my finger-tips as it fell. Had it come
off it would have been something to talk about;
as it was, it cost divers seasoned cricketers a
blink of astonishment.</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>“Dimmy,” said the one wielding the willow,
“aren’t you afraid o’ your backbone at all?”</p>

<p>It was apparent that she was becoming impressed.
With that thought I recalled the words
of the penetrating Archie: “All women have
their weakness. Grace’s is for good fielding.”
I must show her what I could do. After vainly
striving to reach one that she pulled well wide of
mid-on for three, she said,—</p>

<p>“Dimmy, please don’t do that. It worries me.
I’m so afraid that you’ll twist yourself into something
that could never be untied. That would
be horrible, wouldn’t it? And I’m <i>so</i> afraid of
your backbone.”</p>

<p>“It is in your own power,” said I, “to end
these gyrations. You have only got to get out,
you know.”</p>

<p>Her score had now reached twenty. Four
more and a life’s happiness was wrecked. Hope
there was none. She was thoroughly set, and
capable of doing anything with the miserable
stuff that I was rolling up. It was in vain that
I altered the position of the field after the delivery
of every ball. She inevitably dispatched
the one that followed past the precise place from
which the man had just been taken. Her batting
was really cruel in its complacence and resource.
The grim gleam that illuminated her look<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
knocked at my heart. A gleam does <i>not</i> knock
as a rule, I know, but many and strange things are
allowed to happen to the heart of a man in my
desperate predicament. The light-minded fieldsmen
thought it quite a joke, however, and they
proferred no end of wise suggestions. Had I
not better have my point a bit squarer; my mid-off
a bit deeper; my extra cover a bit more
round; and the two men guarding the cucumber frame
standing in front of the cucumbers, instead
of sitting on the woodwork?</p>

<p>I thanked them in a chastened tone for being
so very helpful.</p>

<p>My pitiful bowling has already been the subject
of various painful home truths. But I do believe
that my fielding was not unworthy of kind phrases.
At least, it argues unusual excellence to gain the
open approbation of the great. Yet when I
stopped three smashing half-volley hits in sharp
succession, and cut the knees of Archie’s unmentionables
in a fall I had in endeavouring to
combine the duties of cover-point and the bowler,
I heard Grace sigh most distinctly, and Archie
said,—</p>

<p>“Dimsdale, are these acrobatic performances
intended to divert Grace’s attention from run-getting?
or are they merely to afford a little
variety entertainment to the lookers-on? If that’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
the idea, I think we can compliment you on a
daring and original turn.”</p>

<p>But I repeat that I heard Grace distinctly sigh.
Could it be that my fielding was playing havoc
with that relentless bosom? Oh, that this be so!
Our scores were now level. And was it not
strange that, though Grace had been making runs
precisely as she pleased, she suddenly ceased to
get them altogether? Instead of playing a wonderfully
aggressive and confident game, she began
to vacillate. Nay, she half-heartedly blocked
balls that she had been previously hitting to the
fence. What <i>could</i> it mean? Was it possible
that good fielding was in truth the one weakness
of Grace the unsusceptible? What more likely?
Was she not a cricketer to her finger-tips? and
is not sound fielding as likely to appeal to persons
of that calibre as the higher virtues?</p>

<p>“What’s old Grace rotting at?” cried Charlie.</p>

<p>“My opinion is she wants Dimmy to bowl her,”
said George.</p>

<p>“Just look how she’s nursing the bowling now,”
the Optimist said.</p>

<p>“She might be playin’ Humphreys, the way in
which she pokes at those cuckoos,” said T. S. M.</p>

<p>Grace had now been more than two overs
without getting a run. And the agonized expression
that she wore seemed to say quite plainly,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>“Oh, Dimmy! <i>why</i> don’t you bowl me?”</p>

<p>Yes, my fielding had done it. But of bowling her
I was, alas! physically incapable. In my anxiety
to improve I got worse. Indeed, I was so totally
overborne by the requirements of the situation
that I must have given the match away myself
by bowling a wide had not Grace had the presence
of mind to step across her wicket, and
thereby just succeed in covering a ball that
looked like hitting the fat barrister at point. Her
face appeared to say, “Oh, Dimmy! <i>do</i> keep off
wides and no balls!”</p>

<p>Next ball, however, she took the liberty, as was
her arbitrary fashion, of settling the business for
herself: Grace deliberately knocked down her
wicket. Yes, I repeat it in bald prose: Grace
deliberately knocked down her wicket. As a
preliminary, she withdrew her bat far away from
the ball, evidently in the forlorn hope that she
would be bowled outright. But as the ball did
not happen to be straight by a good deal, and
seeing that so long as she remained in my own
erratic trundling constituted a source of danger
in itself, therefore did she turn round and reduce
the stumps with the back of her bat.</p>

<p>“Why, Grace,” demanded the General Public
eagerly, “what in thunder are you playing at?”</p>

<p>“There’s no declaration law in the Rectory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
rules,” said Grace. “So a side can’t declare its
innings, don’t you see?”</p>

<p>“Been inadvertently omitted,” said Charlie.</p>

<p>“But what did you want to declare for?” said
T. S. M. “You hadn’t won.”</p>

<p>“Yes, tell us why you wanted to declare,” said
Toddles, with his wickedest expression.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was the sun that made Grace so
hot and red; but, be that as it may, the fact must
be put in history.</p>

<p>“’Cause I did,” said Grace.</p>

<p>“A feminine reason, I fear,” said the Rector.</p>

<p>“Well, I think it’s something like this,” said I,
with rather more valour than discretion: “there
must be lots of times, don’t you know, when a
girl would like to declare, and she can’t declare,
because, according to the laws of the game, there’s
no rule whereby she can declare. You see it,
don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Clear as mud,” said Charlie. “She can declare
when she can’t declare, and she—— Say
it again, old chap. Certain to get the hang of
it before the end of the season.”</p>

<p>“O’ course, a girl can’t declare, you know,
Charlie,” said Grace.</p>

<p>“Well, why a girl?” asked Toddles, hiding his
face in his cap. “And why should she want to
declare? And what is it she wants to declare?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>“Depends on what you’re playing at,” said
Archie darkly.</p>

<p>“I am afraid, gentlemen,” said the Rector, “that
you are not entirely familiar with the rules of
the game. I think you may safely leave the
matter with Laura. I’ve always said that she
had more purely technical knowledge than all
the rest of us put together.”</p>

<p>“Beg pardon, sir,” said Biffin, “but I’ve allus
said the very same about Miss Laura. Allus back
<i>her</i> opinion, I would. Although, begging pardon,
sir, I think she’s fair hout this time.”</p>

<p>“Clean bowled, Biffin, I suppose you mean?”
said the Rector.</p>

<p>“Hout, sir, fair hout!” said that ancient
villain, chuckling till the score-book shook.</p>

<p>Meantime the Rector was patting his daughter’s
cheek. And almost simultaneously some person
or persons unknown buffeted me violently in the
ribs. My suspicions rested on Toddles.</p>

<p>“Mr. <span class="smcap">Guy Boothby</span> has come to great honours now. His
name is large upon hoardings, his books sell like hot cakes, and he
keeps a level head through it all. I’ve met him several times in
England, and he added to my already large respect for him.”</p>

<p class="ph1">PHAROS, THE EGYPTIAN.</p>

<p>“This powerful novel is weird, wonderful, and soul-thrilling. Mr. <span class="smcap">Boothby</span>
succeeds in making it almost real, and its marvels and mysteries almost credable.
There never was in this world so strange and wonderful a love story and
Mr. <span class="smcap">Guy Boothby’s</span> admirers will probably agree that the most marvellous fiction
he has ever produced is ‘Pharos, the Egyptian.’”—<i>The Scotsman.</i></p>

<p><span class="drop-cap">T</span>HE late <span class="smcap">G. J. Whyte-Melville</span>, uniting, as he did, the
qualities of poet, novelist, sportsman, and leader of society,
has long been acknowledged to stand above rivalry when dealing
with sport and the romance of old. Although the sale of his
works has always been large, the publishers feel that the time
has now arrived to issue an edition more worthy of his fame,
and have therefore pleasure in announcing a monthly issue of
his novels, complete in about twenty-five volumes. Each volume
will be illustrated by front-rank artists, well printed from type
specially cast, on best antique paper, and neatly and handsomely
bound in cloth gilt.</p>

and vigorous language, it is not to be wondered at that Mr. <span class="smcap">Hocking’s</span>

</div>


<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[A]</a> The <i>Daily Chronicle</i> has since investigated this and conclusively
proved it to be a fable. It seems that human excellence
still has altitudes to scale.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[B]</a> It should be noted that at the Oval it is invariably “a
crowd.” At Lord’s it is correct to say “a company.”</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="label">[C]</a> This incident of the toss seems so impossible that in the
nature of things it ought to be quite true. As a matter of fact,
it is quite true, having actually come within the writer’s experience.
Artistically, though, the accident of its occurrence
makes it neither the more defensible nor the less incredible.
Art ought not to subscribe to the Press Association.</p>
